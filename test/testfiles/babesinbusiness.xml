But this episode is all about you and your health as a business owner in particular if you spend a lot of time in front of your computer working and exposing your body to high levels of toxic blue light, like us, we work 100% online and sometimes you’ll see us pulling 16+ hour days, all in front of the computer. So this episode was AMAZZZZING because they explain to us the difference between good and bad light. It’s so educational, the guys do a really good job of helping us understand the sources of blue light that we’re exposed to every day and what we can do about it, and how blue light is compromising our health, sleep, energy, hormones and more. And how to mitigate the damage by blue light and the hacks we can implant into our life today. <br><br>Now you might not be business owner, maybe you’re one of the many people at home right now in isolation with whats going on in the world right now and if that's you, we can bet our bottom dollar you are at home on your phone and in front of the tv more than you have ever been before. If you’re either of these two - this episode is for you. <br><br><em>What do you do when so many modern-day health issues point to artificial blue light as a cause yet so many products designed to address it are cheaply made, not backed by science and, well let’s face it – ugly, that very few people are embracing light management? <br></em><strong> Well, you create a company that flips all that on its head. </strong><br><br>And that’s exactly what Andy &amp; Katie have done with BLUblox - they’ve created a world-leading advanced light-filtering eyewear that is medically backed by science …. which after talking with these 2, I am soooooo excited for my very own pair to come in the mail, I've just checked my tracking number and I should have them in my hands in just a couple of days I cannot wait. Now if you’d love to get yourself a pair, and trust me you’re going to want a pair of blue blox over any other and this episode will help you understand why, make sure you head over to the blue box website and you can us our very own discount code "BTB" on check out You can find all their details such as their website, Instagram &amp; discount code all in the show notes below. <br><br>website: <a href="https://www.blublox.com">www.blublox.com</a><br>instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blubloxofficial/?hl=en" target="">instagram.com/blubloxofficial </a><br>Facebook: <a href="facebook.com/blublox ">facebook.com/blublox </a><br>Podcast coming soon: www.tsypodcast.com (launching April)<br></p><p class="">_________________________________________________</p><p class=""></p><p class="">OUR SOCIALS</p><p class="">website: <a href="https://www.babestalkingbusiness.com">www.babestalkingbusiness.com</a></p><p class="">instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness/</a><br></p><p class="">Lauren's website: <a href="http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au " target="_blank">http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au</a></p><p class="">Lauren's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/</a></p><p class="">Laurens Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw</a><br></p><p class="">Chani's youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/chanicarroso" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/chanicarroso</a></p><p class="">Chani's website: <a href="http://www.healthypeach.net" target="_blank">http://www.healthypeach.net</a></p><p class="">Chani's Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chanipeach" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/chanipeach</a></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Babes Talking Business</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:50:45</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32/5e817fb3b4d2702165ab7892/1585640606719/1500w/90344960_737652936639683_4056164275369017344_n.jpg"/><itunes:season>3</itunes:season><itunes:episode>41</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Ep: 41 Protecting your health as a Business Owner with Andy and Katie Mant CoFounder of Blublox</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5e81818747c7f816da091986/1585548348504/Episode+41+Protecting+your+health+as+a+Business+Owner+with+Andy+and+Katie+Mant.mp3" length="73087405" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5e81818747c7f816da091986/1585548348504/Episode+41+Protecting+your+health+as+a+Business+Owner+with+Andy+and+Katie+Mant.mp3" length="73087405" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Ep: 41 Protecting your health as a Business Owner with Andy and Katie Mant CoFounder of Blublox</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Episode 40: Eliza Landgren, Founder of Elle Fit Active</title><dc:creator>Babes In Business</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 11:01:29 +0000</pubDate><link>https://babesinbusiness.net/podcast/2020/2/16/eliza-landgren-founder-of-elle-fit-active</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66:5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32:5e4920c9616cdb37a77a8625</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">After learning how to manage pain from scoliosis and navigating her way through chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, Elle brings light to tough times with her authenticity and humour.

She also a Life and Mindset Coach,  Blogger, Speaker and Mentor for thousands of women around the world who want to create a ‘Life Above Zero’.   Lauren holds a Bachelor of Psychology with Honours and is an International accredited Neurolinguistic Practitioner. Lauren started in Child Protection helping families make meaningful change and address Child protection concerns so families could be kept together or reunified after Child protection Orders had been taken. She soon realised she wanted to empower families, especially women with the education, awareness and support to create a life they loved filled with health, wealth and abundance earlier in life so they never found themselves is situations where they were misusing substances to numb emotional pain, settling for jobs or lifestyles that didn’t honour their values, or staying in domestic violent relationships because they didn’t have money of their own or the self belief and self worth to leave. Lauren pivoted and started her own Practise inspiring women to live a "Life Above Zero" a term coined in the positive psychology field that reminds people that happiness and health are more than the absence of unhappiness and disease.</p><p class=""></p><p class="">In the Western world, we now have a higher standard of living than humans have ever known before and yet, humans today don’t seem very happy. We are experiencing a mental health epidemic - the World Health Organisation estimates that depression is currently the fourth biggest, costliest, and most debilitating disease in the world and by the year 2020, it will be the second biggest, so it inspired Lauren to create a space for some REAL TALK, with her book 'Life Above Zero - Making Mindset Manageable, Health holistic, Spirituality Science and Life Liberating'.</p><p class=""></p><p class="">Lauren’s book book equips you with the practical skills and mindset, backed with the psychology, research, and statistics to help you unlock the code to success, in your life, relationships and career (with some positive, warm and fuzzy vibes thrown in, sprinkled with tough love). This book is special because not only does it share personable stories that we can all relate to (reminding you that you are not alone in what you're going through), but it also has the credentials and research behind it giving it the credibility and applicability in the wellness, health and business space.</p><p class=""></p><p class=""><strong>In this episode we talk about;</strong></p><p class="">- What inspired Lauren to write a book</p><p class="">- What the book is about</p><p class="">- Who will best benefit from the book and what you will gain from reading it</p><p class="">- The process of writing and publishing a book in case it's something on your bucket list too!<br><br>Lauren's website: <a href="http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au " target="">http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au</a></p><p class="">Lauren's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/ " target="">https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/</a></p><p class="">Laurens Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw " target="">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw</a></p><p class=""></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Babes Talking Business </itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:32:50</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32/5ded9eacaf06d83e3e5bc480/1578183294327/1500w/Ep35_BlogTumbnail.jpg"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>35</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Episode 35 - Our very own BTB Cohost Lauren King is finally a PUBLISHED AUTHOR of the book 'Life Above Zero'</itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5dedb81fe46e2d0693c8f96b/1575861908809/Episode+35+Our+very+own+BTB+cohost+Lauren+King+is+officially+a+PUBLISHED+AUTHOR.mp3" length="47286994" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5dedb81fe46e2d0693c8f96b/1575861908809/Episode+35+Our+very+own+BTB+cohost+Lauren+King+is+officially+a+PUBLISHED+AUTHOR.mp3" length="47286994" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Episode 35 - Our very own BTB Cohost Lauren King is finally a PUBLISHED AUTHOR of the book 'Life Above Zero'</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Episode 34: Brooke Vulinovich</title><dc:creator>Babes In Business</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 09:36:10 +0000</pubDate><link>https://babesinbusiness.net/podcast/2019/11/24/episode-34-brooke-vulinovich</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66:5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32:5dda4ecd455f406d50c2f6e2</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Brooke Vulinovich is an Instagram specialist, international keynote speaker, founder of Villa Management and creator of the global Social Club Membership and Academy.

Sophie is a Registered Nurse turned certified holistic health coach who fell in love with preventative and holistic health, with manifestation, and wanting to create a life she loved to live, all whilst making an impact in alignment with her values. Soph joined the BIB team 2 years ago and in that time has not only created an incredibly thriving and soul centred business where she helps thousands of women every day, but she’s also recently reached the pinnacle position of our company and is one of our National Marketing Directors who’s built an incredible team both in Australia and internationally. Feeling uninspired, unfulfilled and exhausted working as a Nurse, Sophie joined Babes in Business in January 2017 with the hopes of working for herself, but not by herself, with the beautiful Babes in Biz tribe of uplifting and supporting women alongside her. <br><br>Over this past 2.5 years with ups, downs, challenges and everything in between - Sophie has been able to leave her nursing job, start travelling the world, and working towards the dream of becoming a full time mermaid. She is fiercely passionate about not only empowering women to take charge of their health on a holistic level, but also help them realise that they can be, do, and have anything they desire and to not settle for anything less. In Sophs episode we talk about so many incredible golden nuggets such as the hardship along her journey to success and what it actually looks like getting to the top, she gives us incredible advice on how to manage situations you cant control, we talk about gracious leadership and what that looks like, embracing the duality - the ring and yang - in business, and we ask her if the hardship is really worth it. <br><br>Sophies IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefeelgoodeffect_/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/thefeelgoodeffect_/</a><br><br>—————————————————————————————<br>OUR SOCIALS//</p><p class=""><br>website: <a href="http://www.babestalkingbusiness.com" target="_blank">www.babestalkingbusiness.com</a></p><p class="">instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness/</a><br></p><p class="">Lauren's website: <a href="http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au" target="_blank">http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au</a></p><p class="">Lauren's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero/</a></p><p class="">Lauren’s Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_dv9lDB0rQAwcFSLut5ucw</a></p><p class=""><br>Chani's youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/chanicarroso" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/chanicarroso</a></p><p class="">Chani's website: <a href="http://www.healthypeach.net" target="_blank">http://www.healthypeach.net</a></p><p class="">Chani's Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chanipeach">https://www.instagram.com/chanipeach</a><br></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Babes Talking Business</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:39:45</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32/5d22c8cf13a1670001dea13d/1574409893536/1500w/Ep25_BlogTumbnail.jpg"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>25</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Episode 25 Sophie Ballantyne // Babes in Business National Marketing Director </itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5d22dd1613a1670001df85d8/1562567564226/EPISODE+25++Sophie+Ballantyne++Babes+In+Business+National+Marketing+Director.mp3" length="57240000" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5d22dd1613a1670001df85d8/1562567564226/EPISODE+25++Sophie+Ballantyne++Babes+In+Business+National+Marketing+Director.mp3" length="57240000" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Episode 25 Sophie Ballantyne // Babes in Business National Marketing Director </media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Episode 24: Georgie Stevenson</title><dc:creator>Babes In Business</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 07:01:46 +0000</pubDate><link>https://babesinbusiness.net/podcast/2019/6/23/episode-24-georgie-stevenson</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66:5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32:5d0f1b69a6630100017c77a0</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">This episode is brought to you by The Healthstyle Emporium.

We talk about what it takes to be successful and why chasing shiny objects and the next best thing isn’t going to serve you or your goals of success, we talk about what it means to have grit, the on flow effects of delayed gratification and why that will serve you ten fold compared to giving up when it gets hard, we talk about researching longevity and sustainability in your business, abundant vs scarcity mindset, bad behaviour online from network marketers and how that sadly tarnishes the reputation of this profession, and why getting caught up in hype will do the exact opposite of attracting abundance to you.<br><br>website: <a href="http://www.babestalkingbusiness.com" target="_blank">www.babestalkingbusiness.com</a></p><p class="">instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness</a></p><p class="">Lauren's website: <a href="http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au" target="_blank">http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au</a></p><p class="">Lauren's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero</a></p><p class="">Chani's website: <a href="http://www.healthypeach.net">http://www.healthypeach.net</a></p><p class="">Chani's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/healthypeach_/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/healthypeach_/</a></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Babes Talking Business</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Lauren King and Chani Thompson Co-founders of Babes in Business </itunes:subtitle><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:35:33</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32/5cceb827fa0d6020ec6a8ee8/1574409735488/1500w/Ep21_BlogTumbnail.jpg"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>21</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Episode 21 Why changing Network Marketing Companies won’t serve you  </itunes:title><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><enclosure url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5cceb8424e17b63e4369df62/1557052055172/EPISODE+21++Why+changing+network+marketing+companies+wont+serve+you.mp3" length="51168000" type="audio/mpeg"/><media:content url="https://chtbl.com/track/74D492/static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/t/5cceb8424e17b63e4369df62/1557052055172/EPISODE+21++Why+changing+network+marketing+companies+wont+serve+you.mp3" length="51168000" type="audio/mpeg" isDefault="true" medium="audio"><media:title type="plain">Episode 21 Why changing Network Marketing Companies won’t serve you  </media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Episode 20: Jessica Strauss</title><dc:creator>Babes In Business</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2019 05:58:45 +0000</pubDate><link>https://babesinbusiness.net/podcast/2019/3/31/episode-20-jessica-strauss</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66:5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32:5ca056f52cca3c0001b0ceb1</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks episode we talk to our beautiful friend and Babes in Business member Jessica Strauss, Australia's youngest national marketing director.</p><p>We talk all fun things like building an online business, routine, sacrifices + compromises made on her journey to success.</p><p>▸ Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thehealthybliss_/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/thehealthybliss_/</a><em><br><br>——————————————————-<br><br></em>website: <a href="http://www.babestalkingbusiness.com" target="_blank">www.babestalkingbusiness.com</a></p><p>instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/babestalkingbusiness</a></p><p>Lauren's website: <a href="http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au" target="_blank">http://www.lifeabovezero.com.au</a></p><p>Lauren's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/life_above_zero</a></p><p>Chani's website: <a href="http://www.healthypeach.net">http://www.healthypeach.net</a></p><p>Chani's instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/healthypeach_/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/healthypeach_/</a></p>]]></description><itunes:author>Babes Talking Business</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Australia's Youngest National Marketing Director </itunes:subtitle><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>00:30:54</itunes:duration><itunes:image href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a5db230a803bbe1eeff6d66/5a9b61e253450a4f0f28ab32/5ca056f52cca3c0001b0ceb1/1574409705253/1500w/Ep20_BlogTumbnail.jpg"/><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>20</itunes:episode><itunes:title>Episode 20 -

Rach soon started to realise there were more people out there just like her, dealing with the same issues. 

Before she knew it, her new passion started to pay her as she learnt the power behind network marketing. Tune in to hear how a new life purpose and an entrepreneurial dream has transpired to creating a 7 figure income in less than 4 years. Rach is honest and transparent about her journey in hope she can shed some light and offer some advice to anyone who finds themselves working in a similar situation and wanting better health and a better lifestyle.
