         <description><![CDATA[Companies use about 300,000 times more computation training the best AI systems today than they did in 2012 and algorithmic innovations have also made them 25 times more efficient at the same tasks.<br><br>  

These are the headline results of two recent papers -- <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">AI and Compute</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/">AI and Efficiency</a> -- from the <em>Foresight Team</em> at OpenAI. In today's episode I spoke with one of the authors, Danny Hernandez, who joined OpenAI after helping develop better forecasting methods at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy</a>. <br><br>   

Danny and I talk about how to understand his team's results and what they mean (and don't mean) for how we should think about progress in AI going forward.<br><br>  

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/danny-hernandez-forecasting-ai-progress/?utm_campaign=podcast__danny-hernandez&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br> 

Debates around the future of AI can sometimes be pretty abstract and theoretical. Danny hopes that providing rigorous measurements of some of the inputs to AI progress so far can help us better understand what causes that progress, as well as ground debates about the future of AI in a better shared understanding of the field.<br><br>   

If this research sounds appealing, you might be interested in applying to join OpenAI's Foresight team -- <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/openai/2b4e17f4-d3be-4ac9-be21-664c211c413a">they're currently hiring research engineers</a>.<br><br>   

In the interview, Danny and I also discuss a range of other topics, including:<br><br>  

• The question of which experts to believe<br> 
• Danny's journey to working at OpenAI<br> 
• The usefulness of "decision boundaries"<br> 
• The importance of Moore's law for people who care about the long-term future<br> 
• What OpenAI's Foresight Team's findings might imply for policy<br> 
• The question whether progress in the performance of AI systems is linear<br> 
• The safety teams at OpenAI and who they're looking to hire<br> 
• One idea for finding someone to guide your learning<br> 
• The importance of hardware expertise for making a positive impact<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[In March Professor Marc Lipsitch — Director of Harvard's <em>Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics</em> — abruptly found himself a global celebrity, his social media following growing 40-fold and journalists knocking down his door, as everyone turned to him for information they could trust.<br><br>

Here he lays out where the fight against COVID-19 stands today, why he's open to deliberately giving people COVID-19 to speed up vaccine development, and how we could do better next time.<br><br>

As Marc tells us, island nations like Taiwan and New Zealand are successfully suppressing SARS-COV-2. But everyone else is struggling.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/marc-lipsitch-winning-or-losing-against-covid19-and-epidemiology/?utm_campaign=podcast__marc-lipsitch&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

Even Singapore, with plenty of warning and one of the best test and trace systems in the world, lost control of the virus in mid-April after successfully holding back the tide for 2 months.<br><br>

This doesn't bode well for how the US or Europe will cope as they ease their lockdowns. It also suggests it would have been exceedingly hard for China to stop the virus before it spread overseas.<br><br>

But sadly, there's no easy way out.<br><br>

The original estimates of COVID-19's infection fatality rate, of 0.5-1%, have turned out to be basically right. And the latest serology surveys indicate only 5-10% of people in countries like the US, UK and Spain have been infected so far, leaving us far short of herd immunity. To get there, even these worst affected countries would need to endure something like ten times the number of deaths they have so far.<br><br>

Marc has one good piece of news: research suggests that most of those who get infected do indeed develop immunity, for a while at least.<br><br>

To escape the COVID-19 trap sooner rather than later, Marc recommends we go hard on all the familiar options — vaccines, antivirals, and mass testing — but also open our minds to creative options we've so far left on the shelf.<br><br>

Despite the importance of his work, even now the training and grant programs that produced the community of experts Marc is a part of, are shrinking. We look at a new article he's written about how to instead build and improve the field of epidemiology, so humanity can respond faster and smarter next time we face a disease that could kill millions and cost tens of trillions of dollars.<br><br>

We also cover:<br><br>

• How listeners might contribute as future contagious disease experts, or donors to current projects<br>
• How we can learn from cross-country comparisons<br>
• Modelling that has gone wrong in an instructive way<br>
• What governments should stop doing<br>
• How people can figure out who to trust, and who has been most on the mark this time<br>
• Why Marc supports infecting people with COVID-19 to speed up the development of a vaccines<br>
• How we can ensure there's population-level surveillance early during the next pandemic<br>
• Whether people from other fields trying to help with COVID-19 has done more good than harm<br>
• Whether it's experts in diseases, or experts in forecasting, who produce better disease forecasts<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Amid a rising COVID-19 death toll, and looming economic disaster, we’ve been looking for good news — and one thing we're especially thankful for is the <i>Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security</i> (CHS). <br><br>

CHS focuses on protecting us from major biological, chemical or nuclear disasters, through research that informs governments around the world. While this pandemic surprised many, just last October the Center ran a simulation of a 'new coronavirus' scenario to identify weaknesses in our ability to quickly respond. Their expertise has given them a key role in figuring out how to fight COVID-19. <br><br>

Today’s guest, Dr Tara Kirk Sell, did her PhD in policy and communication during disease outbreaks, and has worked at CHS for 11 years on a range of important projects. <br><br>

• <a href="https://80k.link/tks"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a> <br><br>

Last year she was a leader on <a href="https://80k.link/84X"><b>Collective Intelligence for Disease Prediction</b></a>, designed to sound the alarm about upcoming pandemics before others are paying attention. <br><br>

Incredibly, the project almost closed in December, with COVID-19 just starting to spread around the world — but received new funding that allowed the project to respond quickly to the emerging disease. <br><br>

She also contributed to a recent <a href="https://80k.link/BQN"><b>report</b></a> attempting to explain the risks of specific types of activities resuming when COVID-19 lockdowns end. <br><br>

We can't achieve zero risk — so differentiating activities on a spectrum is crucial. Choosing wisely can help us lead more normal lives without reviving the pandemic. <br><br>

Dance clubs will have to stay closed, but hairdressers can adapt to minimise transmission, and Tara, who happens to be an Olympic silver-medalist in swimming, suggests outdoor non-contact sports could resume soon without much risk. <br><br>

Her latest project deals with the <a href="https://80k.link/RJH"><b>challenge of misinformation during disease outbreaks</b></a>. <br><br>

Analysing the Ebola communication crisis of 2014, they found that even trained coders with public health expertise sometimes needed help to distinguish between true and misleading tweets — showing the danger of a continued lack of definitive information surrounding a virus and how it’s transmitted. <br><br>

The challenge for governments is not simple. If they acknowledge how much they don't know, people may look elsewhere for guidance. But if they pretend to know things they don't, the result can be a huge loss of trust. <br><br>

Despite their intense focus on COVID-19, researchers at CHS know that this is no one-off event. Many aspects of our collective response this time around have been alarmingly poor, and it won’t be long before Tara and her colleagues need to turn their mind to next time. <br><br>

<em>You can now donate to CHS through <a href="https://80k.link/FMG"><b>Effective Altruism Funds</b></a>. Donations made through EA Funds are tax-deductible in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands.</em>  <br><br>

Tara and Rob also discuss: <br><br>

• Who has overperformed and underperformed expectations during COVID-19? <br>
• Whe are people right to mistrust authorities? <br>
• The media’s responsibility to be right <br>
• What policy changes should be prioritised for next time <br>
• Should we prepare for future pandemic while the COVID-19 is still going? <br>
• The importance of keeping non-COVID health problems in mind <br>
• The psychological difference between staying home voluntarily and being forced to <br>
• Mistakes that we in the general public might be making <br>
• Emerging technologies with the potential to reduce global catastrophic biological risks <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Since it was founded, 80,000 Hours has done one-on-one calls to supplement our online content and offer more personalised advice. We try to help people get clear on their most plausible paths, the key uncertainties they face in choosing between them, and provide resources, pointers, and introductions to help them in those paths. <br><br>

I (Michelle Hutchinson) joined the team a couple of years ago after working at Oxford's <em>Global Priorities Institute</em>, and these days I'm 80,000 Hours' Head of Advising. Since then, chatting to hundreds of people about their career plans has given me some idea of the kinds of things it’s useful for people to hear about when thinking through their careers. <br><br>So we thought it would be useful to discuss some on the show for everyone to hear. <br><br>

• <a href="https://80k.link/mh2"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br>
• <a href="https://80k.link/mh-jb"><b>See over 500 vacancies on our job board.</b></a><br>
• <a href="https://80k.link/mh-a"><b>Apply for one-on-one career advising.</b></a><br><br>

Among other common topics, we cover: <br><br>

• Why traditional careers advice involves thinking through what types of roles you enjoy followed by which of those are impactful, while we recommend going the other way: ranking roles on impact, and then going down the list to find the one you think you’d most flourish in. <br>
• That if you’re pitching your job search at the right level of role, you’ll need to apply to a large number of different jobs. So it's wise to broaden your options, by applying for both stretch and backup roles, and not over-emphasising a small number of organisations. <br>
• Our suggested process for writing a longer term career plan: 1. shortlist your best medium to long-term career options, then 2. figure out the key uncertainties in choosing between them, and 3. map out concrete next steps to resolve those uncertainties. <br>
• Why many listeners aren't spending enough time finding out about what the day-to-day work is like in paths they're considering, or reaching out to people for advice or opportunities. <br>
• The difficulty of maintaining the ambition to increase your social impact, while also being proud of and motivated by what you're already accomplishing. <br><br>

I also thought it might be useful to give people a sense of what I do and don’t do in advising calls, to help them figure out if they should sign up for it. <br><br>

If you’re wondering whether you’ll benefit from advising, bear in mind that it tends to be more useful to people: <br><br>

1. With similar views to 80,000 Hours on what the world’s most pressing problems are, because we’ve done most research on the problems we think it’s most important to address. <br>
2. Who don’t yet have close connections with people working at effective altruist organisations. <br>
3. Who aren’t strongly locationally constrained. <br><br>

If you’re unsure, it doesn’t take long to apply, and a lot of people say they find the application form itself helps them reflect on their plans. We’re particularly keen to hear from people from under-represented backgrounds. <br><br>

Also in this episode: <br><br>

• I describe mistakes I’ve made in advising, and career changes made by people I’ve spoken with. <br>
• Rob and I argue about what risks to take with your career, like when it’s sensible to take a study break, or start from the bottom in a new career path. <br>
• I try to forecast how I’ll change after I have a baby, Rob speculates wildly on what motherhood is like, and Arden and I mercilessly mock Rob. <br><br>

We try to help people get clear on their most plausible paths, the key uncertainties they face in choosing between them, and provide resources, pointers, and introductions to help them in those paths. I (Michelle Hutchinson) joined the team a couple of years ago after working at Oxford's Global Priorities Institute, and these days I'm 80,000 Hours' Head of Advising. Since then, chatting to hundreds of people about their career plans has given me some idea of the kinds of things it’s useful for people to hear about when thinking through their careers. So we thought it would be useful to discuss some on the show for everyone to hear. • Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. • See over 500 vacancies on our job board. • Apply for one-on-one career advising. Among other common topics, we cover: • Why traditional careers advice involves thinking through what types of roles you enjoy followed by which of those are impactful, while we recommend going the other way: ranking roles on impact, and then going down the list to find the one you think you’d most flourish in. • That if you’re pitching your job search at the right level of role, you’ll need to apply to a large number of different jobs. So it's wise to broaden your options, by applying for both stretch and backup roles, and not over-emphasising a small number of organisations. • Our suggested process for writing a longer term career plan: 1. shortlist your best medium to long-term career options, then 2. figure out the key uncertainties in choosing between them, and 3. map out concrete next steps to resolve those uncertainties. • Why many listeners aren't spending enough time finding out about what the day-to-day work is like in paths they're considering, or reaching out to people for advice or opportunities. • The difficulty of maintaining the ambition to increase your social impact, while also being proud of and motivated by what you're already accomplishing. I also thought it might be useful to give people a sense of what I do and don’t do in advising calls, to help them figure out if they should sign up for it. If you’re wondering whether you’ll benefit from advising, bear in mind that it tends to be more useful to people: 1. With similar views to 80,000 Hours on what the world’s most pressing problems are, because we’ve done most research on the problems we think it’s most important to address. 2. Who don’t yet have close connections with people working at effective altruist organisations. 3. Who aren’t strongly locationally constrained. If you’re unsure, it doesn’t take long to apply, and a lot of people say they find the application form itself helps them reflect on their plans. We’re particularly keen to hear from people from under-represented backgrounds. Also in this episode: • I describe mistakes I’ve made in advising, and career changes made by people I’ve spoken with. • Rob and I argue about what risks to take with your career, like when it’s sensible to take a study break, or start from the bottom in a new career path. • I try to forecast how I’ll change after I have a baby, Rob speculates wildly on what motherhood is like, and Arden and I mercilessly mock Rob.

         <description><![CDATA[Our lives currently revolve around the global emergency of COVID-19; you’re probably reading this while confined to your house, as the death toll from the worst pandemic since 1918 continues to rise. <br><br>

The question of how to tackle COVID-19 has been foremost in the minds of many, <a href="https://80k.link/gl-c19"><b>including here at 80,000 Hours</b></a>. <br><br>

Today's guest, Dr Gregory Lewis, acting head of the Biosecurity Research Group at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute, puts the crisis in context, explaining how COVID-19 compares to other diseases, pandemics of the past, and possible worse crises in the future. <br><br>

COVID-19 is a vivid reminder that we are unprepared to contain or respond to new pathogens. <br><br>

How would we cope with a virus that was even more contagious and even more deadly? Greg's work focuses on these risks -- of outbreaks that threaten our entire future through an unrecoverable collapse of civilisation, or even the extinction of humanity. <br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/gregl"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

If such a catastrophe were to occur, Greg believes it’s more likely to be caused by accidental or deliberate misuse of biotechnology than by a pathogen developed by nature. <br><br>

There are a few direct causes for concern: humans now have the ability to produce some of the most dangerous diseases in history in the lab; technological progress may enable the creation of pathogens which are nastier than anything we see in nature; and most biotechnology has yet to even be conceived, so we can’t assume all the dangers will be familiar. <br><br>

This is grim stuff, but it needn’t be paralysing. In the years following COVID-19, humanity may be inspired to better prepare for the existential risks of the next century: improving our science, updating our policy options, and enhancing our social cohesion. <br><br>

COVID-19 is a tragedy of stunning proportions, and its immediate threat is undoubtedly worthy of significant resources. <br><br>

But we will get through it; if a future biological catastrophe poses an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911"><i>existential</i> risk</a>, we may not get a second chance. It is therefore vital to learn every lesson we can from this pandemic, and provide our descendants with the security we wish for ourselves. <br><br>

Today’s episode is the hosting debut of our Strategy Advisor, Howie Lempel. <br><br>

80,000 Hours has focused on COVID-19 for the last few weeks and published <a href="https://80k.link/gl-c19"><b>over ten</b></a> pieces about it, and a substantial benefit of this interview was to help inform our own views. As such, at times this episode may feel like eavesdropping on a private conversation, and it is likely to be of most interest to people primarily focused on making the <a href="https://80k.link/gl-fg"><b>long-term future</b></a> go as well as possible. <br><br>

In this episode, Howie and Greg cover: <br><br>

• Reflections on the first few months of the pandemic <br>
• Common confusions around COVID-19 <br>
• How COVID-19 compares to other diseases <br>
• What types of interventions have been available to policymakers <br>
• Arguments for and against working on <a href="https://80k.link/gcbrs"><b>global catastrophic biological risks</b></a> (GCBRs) <br>
• How to know if you’re a good fit to work on GCBRs <br>
• The response of the <a href="https://80k.link/gl-ea"><b>effective altruism community</b></a>, as well as 80,000 Hours in particular, to COVID-19 <br>
• And much more. <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[To do good, most of us look to use our time and money to affect the world around us today. But perhaps that's all wrong. <br><br>

If you took $1,000 you were going to donate and instead put it in the stock market — where it grew on average 5% a year — in 100 years you'd have $125,000 to give away instead. And in 200 years you'd have $17 million. <br><br>

This astonishing fact has driven today's guest, economics researcher Philip Trammell at Oxford's Global Priorities Institute, to <a href="https://80k.link/pt-pdf"><b>investigate the case for and against</b></a> so-called 'patient philanthropy' in depth. If the case for patient philanthropy is as strong as Phil believes, many of us should be trying to improve the world in a very different way than we are now. <br><br>

He points out that on top of being able to dispense vastly more, whenever your trustees decide to use your gift to improve the world, they'll also be able to rely on the much broader knowledge available to future generations. A donor two hundred years ago couldn't have known distributing anti-malarial bed nets was a good idea. Not only did bed nets not exist — we didn't even know about germs, and almost nothing in medicine was justified by science. <br><br>

<i>ADDED: Does the COVID-19 emergency mean we should actually use resources right now? See Phil's <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/phil-trammell-patient-philanthropy/#covid"><b>first thoughts on this question here.</b></a></i> <br><br>

• <a href="https://80k.link/ptpp"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a> <br><br>

What similar leaps will our descendants have made in 200 years, allowing your now vast foundation to benefit more people in even greater ways? <br><br>

And there's a third reason to wait as well. What are the odds that we today live at the most critical point in history, when resources happen to have the greatest ability to do good? It's possible. But the future may be very long, so there has to be a good chance that some moment in the future will be both more pivotal and more malleable than our own. <br><br>

Of course, there are many objections to this proposal. If you start a foundation you hope will wait around for centuries, might it not be destroyed in a war, revolution, or financial collapse? <br><br>

Or might it not drift from its original goals, eventually just serving the interest of its distant future trustees, rather than the noble pursuits you originally intended? <br><br>

Or perhaps it could fail for the reverse reason, by staying true to your original vision — if that vision turns out to be as deeply morally mistaken as the Rhodes' Scholarships initial charter, which limited it to 'white Christian men'. <br><br>

Alternatively, maybe the world will change in the meantime, making your gift useless. At one end, humanity might destroy itself before your trust tries to do anything with the money. Or perhaps everyone in the future will be so fabulously wealthy, or the problems of the world already so overcome, that your philanthropy will no longer be able to do much good. <br><br>

Are these concerns, all of them legitimate, enough to overcome the case in favour of patient philanthropy? In today's conversation with researcher Phil Trammell and my 80,000 Hours colleague Howie Lempel, we try to answer that, and also discuss: <br><br>

• Real attempts at patient philanthropy in history and how they worked out <br>
• Should we have a mixed strategy, where some altruists are patient and others impatient? <br>
• Which causes most need money now, and which later? <br>
• What is the research frontier here? <br>
• What does this all mean for what listeners should do differently? <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[This week Oxford academic and 80,000 Hours trustee Dr Toby Ord released his new book <a href="https://theprecipice.com/"><i>The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</i></a>. It's about how our long-term future could be better than almost anyone believes, but also how humanity's recklessness is putting that future at grave risk — in Toby's reckoning, a 1 in 6 chance of being extinguished this century. <br><br>

I loved the book and learned a great deal from it (<a href="https://80k.link/buy-tp"><b>buy it here</b></a>, US and audiobook release March 24). While preparing for this interview I copied out 87 facts that were surprising, shocking or important. Here's a sample of 16: <br><br>

1. The probability of a supervolcano causing a civilisation-threatening catastrophe in the next century is estimated to be 100x that of asteroids and comets combined. <br><br>
2. The Biological Weapons Convention — a global agreement to protect humanity — has just four employees, and a smaller budget than an average McDonald’s. <br><br>
3. In 2008 a 'gamma ray burst' reached Earth from another galaxy, 10 billion light years away. It was still bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. We aren't sure what generates gamma ray bursts but one cause may be two neutron stars colliding. <br><br>
4. Before detonating the first nuclear weapon, scientists in the Manhattan Project feared that the high temperatures in the core, unprecedented for Earth, might be able to ignite the hydrogen in water. This would set off a self-sustaining reaction that would burn off the Earth’s oceans, killing all life above ground. They thought this was unlikely, but many atomic scientists feared their calculations could be missing something. As far as we know, the US President was never informed of this possibility, but similar risks were one reason Hitler stopped… <br><br>

<i>N.B. I've had to cut off this list as we only get 4,000 characters in these show notes, so:</i> <br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/ord-2"><b>Click here to read the whole list, see a full transcript, and find related links.</b></a> <br><br>

And if you like the list, you can <a href="https://80000hours.org/the-precipice/"><b>get a free copy of the introduction and first chapter</b></a> by joining our mailing list. <br><br>

While I've been studying these topics for years and known Toby for the last eight, a remarkable amount of what's in <i>The Precipice</i> was new to me. <br><br>

Of course the book isn't a series of isolated amusing facts, but rather a systematic review of the many ways humanity's future could go better or worse, how we might know about them, and what might be done to improve the odds. <br><br>

And that's how we approach this conversation, first talking about each of the main threats, then how we can learn about things that have never happened before, then finishing with what a great future for humanity might look like and how it might be achieved. <br><br>

Toby is a famously good explainer of complex issues — a bit of a modern Carl Sagan character — so as expected this was a great interview, and one which Arden Koehler and I barely even had to work for. <br><br>

Some topics Arden and I ask about include: <br><br>

• What Toby changed his mind about while writing the book <br>
• Are people exaggerating when they say that climate change could actually end civilization? <br>
• What can we learn from historical pandemics? <br>
• Toby’s estimate of unaligned AI causing human extinction in the next century <br>
• Is this century the most important time in human history, or is that a narcissistic delusion? <br>
• Competing vision for humanity's ideal future <br>
• And more. <br><br>

It's about how our long-term future could be better than almost anyone believes, but also how humanity's recklessness is putting that future at grave risk — in Toby's reckoning, a 1 in 6 chance of being extinguished this century. I loved the book and learned a great deal from it (buy it here, US and audiobook release March 24). While preparing for this interview I copied out 87 facts that were surprising, shocking or important. Here's a sample of 16: 1. The probability of a supervolcano causing a civilisation-threatening catastrophe in the next century is estimated to be 100x that of asteroids and comets combined. 2. The Biological Weapons Convention — a global agreement to protect humanity — has just four employees, and a smaller budget than an average McDonald’s. 3. In 2008 a 'gamma ray burst' reached Earth from another galaxy, 10 billion light years away. It was still bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. We aren't sure what generates gamma ray bursts but one cause may be two neutron stars colliding. 4. Before detonating the first nuclear weapon, scientists in the Manhattan Project feared that the high temperatures in the core, unprecedented for Earth, might be able to ignite the hydrogen in water. This would set off a self-sustaining reaction that would burn off the Earth’s oceans, killing all life above ground. They thought this was unlikely, but many atomic scientists feared their calculations could be missing something. As far as we know, the US President was never informed of this possibility, but similar risks were one reason Hitler stopped… N.B. I've had to cut off this list as we only get 4,000 characters in these show notes, so: Click here to read the whole list, see a full transcript, and find related links. And if you like the list, you can get a free copy of the introduction and first chapter by joining our mailing list. While I've been studying these topics for years and known Toby for the last eight, a remarkable amount of what's in The Precipice was new to me. Of course the book isn't a series of isolated amusing facts, but rather a systematic review of the many ways humanity's future could go better or worse, how we might know about them, and what might be done to improve the odds. And that's how we approach this conversation, first talking about each of the main threats, then how we can learn about things that have never happened before, then finishing with what a great future for humanity might look like and how it might be achieved. Toby is a famously good explainer of complex issues — a bit of a modern Carl Sagan character — so as expected this was a great interview, and one which Arden Koehler and I barely even had to work for. Some topics Arden and I ask about include: • What Toby changed his mind about while writing the book • Are people exaggerating when they say that climate change could actually end civilization? • What can we learn from historical pandemics? • Toby’s estimate of unaligned AI causing human extinction in the next century • Is this century the most important time in human history, or is that a narcissistic delusion? • Competing vision for humanity's ideal future • And more.

         <description><![CDATA[The 80,000 Hours Podcast is about “the world’s most pressing problems and how you can use your career to solve them”, and in this episode we tackle that question in the most direct way possible. <br><br>

Last year we published a summary of all our <a href="https://80k.link/ki-bt"><b>key ideas</b></a>, which links to many of our other articles, and which we are aiming to keep updated as our opinions shift. <br><br>

All of us added something to it, but the single biggest contributor was our CEO and today's guest, Ben Todd, who founded 80,000 Hours along with Will MacAskill back in 2012. <br><br>

This key ideas page is the most read on the site. By itself it can teach you a large fraction of the most important things we've discovered since we started investigating high impact careers. <br><br>

But it's perhaps more accurate to think of it as a mini-book, as it weighs in at over 20,000 words. <br><br>

Fortunately it's designed to be highly modular and it's easy to work through it over multiple sessions, scanning over the articles it links to on each topic. <br><br>

Perhaps though, you'd prefer to absorb our most essential ideas in conversation form, in which case this episode is for you. <br><br>

If you want to have a big impact with your career, and you say you're only going to read one article from us, we recommend you read our <a href="https://80k.link/ki-bt"><b>key ideas</b></a> page. <br><br>

And likewise, if you're only going to listen to one of our podcast episodes, it should be this one. We have fun and set a strong pace, running through: <br><br>

• Common misunderstandings of our advice <br>
• A high level overview of what 80,000 Hours generally recommends <br>
• Our key moral positions <br>
• What are the most pressing problems to work on and why? <br>
• Which careers effectively contribute to solving those problems? <br>
• Central aspects of career strategy like how to weigh up career capital, personal fit, and exploration <br>
• As well as plenty more. <br><br>

One benefit of this podcast over the article is that we can more easily communicate uncertainty, and dive into the things we're least sure about, or didn’t yet cover within the article. <br><br>

Note though that our what’s in the article is more precisely stated, our advice is going to keep shifting, and we're aiming to keep the key ideas page current as our thinking evolves over time. This episode was recorded in November 2019, so if you notice a conflict between the page and this episode in the future, go with the page! <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Today's bonus episode of the podcast is a quick conversation between me and my fellow 80,000 Hours researcher Arden Koehler about a few topics, including the demandingness of morality, work-life balance, and emotional reactions to injustice. <br><br>

Arden is about to graduate with a philosophy PhD from New York University, so naturally we dive right into some challenging implications of utilitarian philosophy and how it might be applied to real life. Issues we talk about include: <br><br>

• If you’re not going to be completely moral, should you try being a bit more ethical, or give up? <br>
• Should you feel angry if you see an injustice, and if so, why? <br>
• How much should we ask people to live frugally? <br><br>

So far the feedback on the post-episode chats that we've done have been positive, so we thought we'd go ahead and try out this freestanding one. But fair warning: it's among the more difficult episodes to follow, and probably not the best one to listen to first, as you'll benefit from having more context!<br><br>

If you'd like to listen to more of Arden you can find her in episode 67, <b><a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-chalmers-nature-ethics-consciousness/">David Chalmers on the nature and ethics of consciousness</a>,</b> or episode 66, <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/peter-singer-advocacy-and-the-life-you-can-save/"><b>Peter Singer on being provocative, EA, and how his moral views have changed</b></a>. <br><br>

Here's more information on some of the issues we touch on:<br><br>

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism"><b>Consequentialism</b></a> on Wikipedia<br>
• <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions/"><b>Appropriate dispositions</b></a> on the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy<br>
• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demandingness_objection"><b>Demandingness objection</b></a> on Wikipedia<br>
• And a paper on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20117752?seq=1"><b>epistemic normativity</b></a>. <br><br>

This is a precarious situation, especially with advances in biotechnology increasing our ability to modify viruses and bacteria as we like.<br><br>

In today's episode, Cassidy Nelson, a medical doctor and research scholar at Oxford University's <i>Future of Humanity Institute</i>, explains 12 things her research group think urgently need to happen if we're to keep the risk at acceptable levels. The ideas are:<br><br>

<b>Science</b><br><br>
1. Roll out genetic sequencing tests that lets you test someone for all known and unknown pathogens in one go.<br>
2. Fund research into faster ‘platform’ methods for going from pathogen to vaccine, perhaps using innovation prizes.<br>
3. Fund R&amp;D into broad-spectrum drugs, especially antivirals, similar to how we have generic antibiotics against multiple types of bacteria.
<br><br>
<b>Response</b>
<br><br>
4. Develop a national plan for responding to a severe pandemic, regardless of the cause. Have a backup plan for when things are so bad the normal processes have stopped working entirely.<br>
5. Rigorously evaluate in what situations travel bans are warranted. (They're more often counterproductive.)<br>
6. Coax countries into more rapidly sharing their medical data, so that during an outbreak the disease can be understood and countermeasures deployed as quickly as possible.<br>
7. Set up genetic surveillance in hospitals, public transport and elsewhere, to detect new pathogens before an outbreak — or even before patients develop symptoms.<br>
8. Run regular tabletop exercises within governments to simulate how a pandemic response would play out.
<br><br>
<b>Oversight</b>
<br><br>
9. Mandate disclosure of accidents in the biosafety labs which handle the most dangerous pathogens.<br>
10. Figure out how to govern DNA synthesis businesses, to make it harder to mail order the DNA of a dangerous pathogen.<br>
11. Require full cost-benefit analysis of 'dual-use' research projects that can generate global risks.<br>
 <br>
12. And finally, to maintain momentum, it's necessary to clearly assign responsibility for the above to particular individuals and organisations.<br><br>

These advances can be pursued by politicians and public servants, as well as academics, entrepreneurs and doctors, opening the door for many listeners to pitch in to help solve this incredibly pressing problem.<br><br>

In the episode Rob and Cassidy also talk about:<br><br>

• How Cassidy went from clinical medicine to a PhD studying novel pathogens with pandemic potential.<br>
• The pros, and significant cons, of travel restrictions.<br>

         <description><![CDATA[The State Council of China's 2017 AI plan was the starting point of China’s AI planning; China’s approach to AI is defined by its top-down and monolithic nature; China is winning the AI arms race; and there is little to no discussion of issues of AI ethics and safety in China. How many of these ideas have you heard? <br><br>

In his paper <a href="https://80k.link/dcaid"><b>Deciphering China's AI Dream</b></a>, today's guest, PhD student Jeff Ding, outlines why he believes none of these claims are true. <br><br> 

• <b><a href="https://80k.link/jding">Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</a></b><br><br> 

• <b><a href="https://80k.link/best-charity">What’s the best charity to donate to?</a></b><br><br>

He first places China’s new AI strategy in the <b>context</b> of its past science and technology plans, as well as other countries’ AI plans. What is China actually doing in the space of AI development? <br><br>

Jeff emphasises that China's AI strategy did not appear out of nowhere with the 2017 state council AI development plan, which attracted a lot of overseas attention. Rather that was just another step forward in a long trajectory of increasing focus on science and technology. It's connected with a plan to develop an 'Internet of Things', and linked to a history of strategic planning for technology in areas like aerospace and biotechnology. <br><br>

And it was not just the central government that was moving in this space; companies were already pushing forward in AI development, and local level governments already had their own AI plans. You could argue that the central government was following their lead in AI more than the reverse. <br><br>

What are the different levers that China is pulling to try to spur AI development? <br><br>

Here, Jeff wanted to challenge the myth that China's AI development plan is based on a monolithic central plan requiring people to develop AI. In fact, bureaucratic agencies, companies, academic labs, and local governments each set up their own strategies, which sometimes conflict with the central government. <br><br>

Are China's AI <b>capabilities</b> especially impressive? In the paper Jeff develops a new index to measure and compare the US and China's progress in AI. <br><br>

Jeff’s AI Potential Index — which incorporates trends and capabilities in data, hardware, research and talent, and the commercial AI ecosystem — indicates China’s AI capabilities are about half those of America. His measure, though imperfect, dispels the notion that China's AI capabilities have surpassed the US or make it the world's leading AI power.  <br><br>

Following that 2017 plan, a lot of Western observers thought that to have a good national AI strategy we'd need to figure out how to play catch-up with China. Yet Chinese strategic thinkers and writers at the time actually thought that they were behind — because the Obama administration had issued a series of three white papers in 2016. <br><br>

Finally, Jeff turns to the potential <b>consequences</b> of China’s AI dream for issues of national security, economic development, AI safety and social governance. <br><br>

He claims that, despite the widespread belief to the contrary, substantive discussions about AI safety and ethics are indeed emerging in China. For instance, a new book from Tencent’s Research Institute is proactive in calling for stronger awareness of AI safety issues. <br><br>

In today’s episode, Rob and Jeff go through this widely-discussed report, and also cover: <br><br>

• The best analogies for thinking about the growing influence of AI <br>
• How do prominent Chinese figures think about AI? <br>
• Coordination with China<br>
• China’s social credit system <br>
• Suggestions for people who want to become professional China specialists <br>
• And more.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[You’re given a box with a set of dice in it. If you roll an even number, a person's life is saved. If you roll an odd number, someone else will die. Each time you shake the box you get $10. Should you do it? <br><br>

A committed consequentialist might say, <em>"Sure! Free money!"</em> But most will think it obvious that you should say no. You've only gotten a tiny benefit, in exchange for moral responsibility over whether other people live or die. <br><br>

And yet, according to today’s return guest, philosophy Prof Will MacAskill, in a real sense we’re shaking this box every time we leave the house, and those who think shaking the box is wrong should probably also be shutting themselves indoors and minimising their interactions with others. <br><br>

To see this, imagine you’re deciding whether to redeem a coupon for a free movie. If you go, you’ll need to drive to the cinema. By affecting traffic throughout the city, you’ll have slightly impacted the schedules of thousands or tens of thousands of people. The average life is about 30,000 days, and over the course of a life the average person will have about two children. So — if you’ve impacted at least 7,500 days — then, statistically speaking, you've probably influenced the exact timing of a conception event. With 200 million sperm in the running each time, changing the moment of copulation, even by a fraction of a second, will almost certainly mean you've changed the identity of a future person. <br><br>

That different child will now impact all sorts of things as they go about their life, including future conception events. And then those new people will impact further future conceptions events, and so on. After 100 or maybe 200 years, basically everybody alive will be a different person because you went to the movies. <br><br>

As a result, you’ll have changed when many people die. Take car crashes as one example: about 1.3% of people die in car crashes. Over that century, as the identities of everyone change as a result of your action, many of the 'new' people will cause car crashes that wouldn't have occurred in their absence, including crashes that prematurely kill people alive today. <br><br>

Of course, in expectation, exactly the same number of people will have been saved from car crashes, and will die later than they would have otherwise. <br><br>

So, if you go for this drive, you’ll save hundreds of people from premature death, and cause the early death of an equal number of others. But you’ll get to see a free movie, worth $10. Should you do it? <br><br>

This setup forms the basis of ‘the paralysis argument’, explored in one of Will’s <a href="https://80k.link/paral"><b>recent papers</b></a>. <br><br>

Because most 'non-consequentialists' endorse an act/omission distinction… <em>post truncated due to character limit, <a href="https://80k.link/will2"><b>finish reading the full explanation here.</b></a></em> <br><br>

So what's the best way to fix this strange conclusion? We discuss a few options, but the most promising might bring people a lot closer to full consequentialism than is immediately apparent. In this episode Will and I also cover: <br><br>

• Are, or are we not, living in the most influential time in history? <br>
• The culture of the effective altruism community <br>
• Will's new lower estimate of the risk of human extinction <br>
• Why Will is now less focused on AI <br>
• The differences between Americans and Brits <br>
• Why feeling guilty about characteristics you were born with is crazy <br>

         <description><![CDATA[<b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in October 2018. </b><br><br>

<p>Paul Christiano is one of the smartest people I know. After our first session produced such great material, we decided to do a second recording, resulting in our longest interview so far. While challenging at times I can strongly recommend listening — Paul works on AI himself and has a very unusually thought through view of how it will change the world. This is now the top resource I'm going to refer people to if they're interested in positively shaping the development of AI, and want to understand the problem better. Even though I'm familiar with Paul's writing I felt I was learning a great deal and am now in a better position to make a difference to the world.<br><br>

A few of the topics we cover are:<br><br>• Why Paul expects AI to transform the world gradually rather than explosively and what that would look like<br>
• Several concrete methods OpenAI is trying to develop to ensure AI systems do what we want even if they become more competent than us<br>
• Why AI systems will probably be granted legal and property rights<br>
• How an advanced AI that doesn't share human goals could still have moral value<br>
• Why machine learning might take over science research from humans before it can do most other tasks<br>
• Which decade we should expect human labour to become obsolete, and how this should affect your savings plan.<br><br>

Here's a situation we all regularly confront: you want to answer a difficult question, but aren't quite smart or informed enough to figure it out for yourself. The good news is you have access to experts who *are* smart enough to figure it out. The bad news is that they disagree.<br><br>

If given plenty of time — and enough arguments, counterarguments and counter-counter-arguments between all the experts — should you eventually be able to figure out which is correct? What if one expert were deliberately trying to mislead you? And should the expert with the correct view just tell the whole truth, or will competition force them to throw in persuasive lies in order to have a chance of winning you over?<br><br>

In other words: does 'debate', in principle, lead to truth?<br><br>

According to Paul Christiano — researcher at the machine learning research lab OpenAI and legendary thinker in the effective altruism and rationality communities — this question is of more than mere philosophical interest. That's because 'debate' is a promising method of keeping artificial intelligence aligned with human goals, even if it becomes much more intelligent and sophisticated than we are.<br><br>

It's a method OpenAI is <a href="https://blog.openai.com/debate/">actively trying to develop</a>, because in the long-term it wants to train AI systems to make decisions that are too complex for any human to grasp, but without the risks that arise from a complete loss of human oversight.<br><br> 

If AI-1 is free to choose any line of argument in order to attack the ideas of AI-2, and AI-2 always seems to successfully defend them, it suggests that every possible line of argument would have been unsuccessful.<br><br>

But does that mean that the ideas of AI-2 were actually right? It would be nice if the optimal strategy in debate were to be completely honest, provide good arguments, and respond to counterarguments in a valid way. But we don't know that's the case.<br><br>

Paul Christiano is one of the smartest people I know. After our first session produced such great material, we decided to do a second recording, resulting in our longest interview so far. While challenging at times I can strongly recommend listening — Paul works on AI himself and has a very unusually thought through view of how it will change the world. This is now the top resource I'm going to refer people to if they're interested in positively shaping the development of AI, and want to understand the problem better. Even though I'm familiar with Paul's writing I felt I was learning a great deal and am now in a better position to make a difference to the world. A few of the topics we cover are: • Why Paul expects AI to transform the world gradually rather than explosively and what that would look like • Several concrete methods OpenAI is trying to develop to ensure AI systems do what we want even if they become more competent than us • Why AI systems will probably be granted legal and property rights • How an advanced AI that doesn't share human goals could still have moral value • Why machine learning might take over science research from humans before it can do most other tasks • Which decade we should expect human labour to become obsolete, and how this should affect your savings plan. • Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. • Rohin Shah's AI alignment newsletter. Here's a situation we all regularly confront: you want to answer a difficult question, but aren't quite smart or informed enough to figure it out for yourself. The good news is you have access to experts who *are* smart enough to figure it out. The bad news is that they disagree. If given plenty of time — and enough arguments, counterarguments and counter-counter-arguments between all the experts — should you eventually be able to figure out which is correct? What if one expert were deliberately trying to mislead you? And should the expert with the correct view just tell the whole truth, or will competition force them to throw in persuasive lies in order to have a chance of winning you over? In other words: does 'debate', in principle, lead to truth? According to Paul Christiano — researcher at the machine learning research lab OpenAI and legendary thinker in the effective altruism and rationality communities — this question is of more than mere philosophical interest. That's because 'debate' is a promising method of keeping artificial intelligence aligned with human goals, even if it becomes much more intelligent and sophisticated than we are. It's a method OpenAI is actively trying to develop, because in the long-term it wants to train AI systems to make decisions that are too complex for any human to grasp, but without the risks that arise from a complete loss of human oversight. If AI-1 is free to choose any line of argument in order to attack the ideas of AI-2, and AI-2 always seems to successfully defend them, it suggests that every possible line of argument would have been unsuccessful. But does that mean that the ideas of AI-2 were actually right? It would be nice if the optimal strategy in debate were to be completely honest, provide good arguments, and respond to counterarguments in a valid way. But we don't know that's the case.

         <description><![CDATA[<b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in May 2018. </b><br><br>

Joseph Stalin had a life-extension program dedicated to making himself immortal. What if he had succeeded? <br><br>

According to&nbsp;<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-case-for-and-against-education/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg-2&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast" style="font-weight: bold;">Bryan Caplan</a>&nbsp;in episode #32, there’s an 80% chance that Stalin would still be ruling Russia today. Today’s guest disagrees. <br><br>

Like Stalin he has eyes for his own immortality - including an insurance plan that will cover the cost of cryogenically freezing himself after he dies - and thinks the technology to achieve it might be around the corner. <br><br>

Fortunately for humanity though, that guest is probably one of the nicest people on the planet: Dr Anders Sandberg of Oxford University. <br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-extending-life/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg-2&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript of the conversation, summary, and links to learn more.</b></a> <br><br>

The potential availability of technology to delay or even stop ageing means this disagreement matters, so he has been trying to model what would really happen if both the very best and the very worst people in the world could live forever - among many other questions. <br><br>

Anders, who studies low-probability high-stakes risks and the impact of technological change at the Future of Humanity Institute, is the first guest to appear twice on the 80,000 Hours Podcast and might just be the most interesting academic at Oxford. <br><br>

His research interests include more or less everything, and bucking the academic trend towards intense specialization has earned him a devoted fan base. <br><br>

Last time we asked him <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-fermi-paradox/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg-2&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast">why we don’t see aliens, and how to most efficiently colonise the universe</a>. In today’s episode we ask about Anders’ other recent papers, including: <br><br>

• Is it worth the money to freeze your body after death in the hope of future revival, like Anders has done? <br>• How much is our perception of the risk of nuclear war biased by the fact that we wouldn’t be alive to think about it had one happened? <br>• If biomedical research lets us slow down ageing would culture stagnate under the crushing weight of centenarians? <br>• What long-shot drugs can people take in their 70s to stave off death? <br>• Can science extend human (waking) life by cutting our need to sleep? <br>• How bad would it be if a solar flare took down the electricity grid? Could it happen? <br>
• If you’re a scientist and you discover something exciting but dangerous, when should you keep it a secret and when should you share it? <br>• Will lifelike robots make us more inclined to dehumanise one another? <br><br>

Immanuel Kant is a profoundly influential figure in modern philosophy, and was one of the earliest proponents for universal democracy and international cooperation. He <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-moral-philosophy/?utm_campaign=podcast__will-macaskill&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast">also thought</a> that women have no place in civil society, that it was okay to kill illegitimate children, and that there was a ranking in the moral worth of different races. <br><br>
 
Throughout history we’ve consistently believed, as common sense, truly horrifying things by today’s standards. According to University of Oxford Professor Will MacAskill, it’s extremely likely that we’re in the same boat today. If we accept that we’re probably making major moral errors, how should we proceed?<br><br><b>•&nbsp;<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-moral-philosophy/?utm_campaign=podcast__will-macaskill&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast">Full transcript, key points &amp; links to articles discussed in the show.</a></b> <br><br>
 
If our morality is tied to common sense intuitions, we’re probably just preserving these biases and moral errors. Instead we need to develop a moral view that criticises common sense intuitions, and gives us a chance to move beyond them. And if humanity is going to spread to the stars it could be worth dedicating hundreds or thousands of years to moral reflection, lest we spread our errors far and wide. <br><br>
 
Will is an Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University, author of Doing Good Better, and one of the co-founders of the effective altruism (EA) community. In this interview we discuss a wide range of topics: <br><br>
 
• How would we go about a ‘long reflection’ to fix our moral errors? <br>
• Will’s forthcoming book on how one should reason and act if you don't know which moral theory is correct. What are the practical implications of so-called ‘moral uncertainty’? <br>
• If we basically solve existential risks, what does humanity do next? <br>
• What are some of Will’s most unusual philosophical positions? <br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in October 2018. </b><br><br>

The barista gives you your coffee and change, and you walk away from the busy line. But you suddenly realise she gave you $1 less than she should have. Do you brush your way past the people now waiting, or just accept this as a dollar you’re never getting back? According to philosophy Professor Hilary Greaves - Director of Oxford University's <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org">Global Priorities Institute</a>, which <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/opportunities/">is hiring</a> - this simple decision will completely change the long-term future by altering the identities of almost all future generations. <br><br>

How? Because by rushing back to the counter, you slightly change the timing of everything else people in line do during that day - including changing the timing of the interactions they have with everyone else. Eventually these causal links will reach someone who was going to conceive a child. <br><br>

By causing a child to be conceived a few fractions of a second earlier or later, you change the sperm that fertilizes their egg, resulting in a totally different person. So asking for that $1 has now made the difference between all the things that this actual child will do in their life, and all the things that the merely possible child - who didn't exist because of what you did - would have done if you decided not to worry about it. <br><br>

As that child's actions ripple out to everyone else who conceives down the generations, ultimately the entire human population will become different, all for the sake of your dollar. Will your choice cause a future Hitler to be born, or not to be born? Probably both! <br><br>

<b>•&nbsp;<a href="https://80k.link/hgreaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</a> </b><br><br>

Some find this concerning. The actual long term effects of your decisions are so unpredictable, it looks like you’re totally clueless about what's going to lead to the best outcomes. It might lead to decision paralysis - you won’t be able to take any action at all. <br><br>

Prof Greaves doesn’t share this concern for most real life decisions. If there’s no reasonable way to assign probabilities to far-future outcomes, then the possibility that you might make things better in completely unpredictable ways is more or less canceled out by equally likely opposite possibility. <br><br>

But, if instead we’re talking about a decision that involves highly-structured, systematic reasons for thinking there might be a general tendency of your action to make things better or worse -- for example if we increase economic growth -- Prof Greaves says that we don’t get to just ignore the unforeseeable effects. <br><br>

When there are complex arguments on both sides, it's unclear what probabilities you should assign to this or that claim. Yet, given its importance, whether you should take the action in question actually does depend on figuring out these numbers. So, what do we do? <br><br>

Today’s episode blends philosophy with an exploration of the mission and research agenda of the Global Priorities Institute: to develop the effective altruism movement within academia. We cover: <br><br>

• How controversial is the multiverse interpretation of quantum physics? <br>
• Given moral uncertainty, how should population ethics affect our real life decisions? <br>
• What are the consequences of cluelessness for those who based their donation advice on GiveWell style recommendations? <br>
• How could reducing extinction risk be a good cause for risk-averse people? <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[What is it like to be you right now? You're seeing this text on the screen, smelling the coffee next to you, and feeling the warmth of the cup. There’s a lot going on in your head — your conscious experience. <br><br>

Now imagine beings that are identical to humans, but for one thing: they lack this conscious experience. If you spill your coffee on them, they’ll jump like anyone else, but inside they'll feel no pain and have no thoughts: the lights are off. <br><br>

The concept of these so-called 'philosophical zombies' was popularised by today’s guest — celebrated philosophy professor David Chalmers — in order to explore the nature of consciousness. In a forthcoming book he poses a classic 'trolley problem': <br><br>

"Suppose you have a conscious human on one train track, and five non-conscious humanoid zombies on another. If you do nothing, a trolley will hit and kill the conscious human. If you flip a switch to redirect the trolley, you can save the conscious human, but in so doing kill the five non-conscious humanoid zombies. What should you do?" <br><br>

Many people think you should divert the trolley, precisely because the lack of conscious experience means the moral status of the zombies is much reduced or absent entirely. <br><br>

So, which features of consciousness qualify someone for moral consideration? One view is that the only conscious states that matter are those that have a positive or negative quality, like pleasure and suffering. But Dave’s intuitions are quite different. <br><br>

Instead of zombies he asks us to consider 'Vulcans', who can see and hear and reflect on the world around them, but are incapable of experiencing pleasure or pain. <br><br>

Now imagine a further trolley problem: suppose you have a normal human on one track, and five Vulcans on the other. Should you divert the trolley to kill the five Vulcans in order to save the human? <br><br>

Dave firmly believes the answer is no, and if he's right, pleasure and suffering can’t be the only things required for moral status. The fact that Vulcans are conscious in other ways must matter in itself. <br><br>

Dave is one of the world's top experts on the philosophy of consciousness. He helped return the question <i>'what is consciousness?'</i> to the centre stage of philosophy with his 1996 book <i>'The Conscious Mind'</i>, which argued against then-dominant materialist theories of consciousness. <br><br>

This comprehensive interview, at over four hours long, outlines each contemporary theory of consciousness, what they have going for them, and their likely ethical implications. Those theories span the full range from illusionism, the idea that consciousness is in some sense an 'illusion', to panpsychism, according to which it's a fundamental physical property present in all matter. <br><br>

These questions are absolutely central for anyone who wants to build a positive future. If insects were conscious our treatment of them could already be an atrocity. If computer simulations of people will one day be conscious, how will we know, and how should we treat them? And what is it about consciousness that matters, if anything? <br><br>

Dave Chalmers is probably the best person on the planet to ask these questions, and Rob & Arden cover this and much more over the course of what is both our longest ever episode, and our personal favourite so far.  <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[In 1989, the professor of moral philosophy Peter Singer was all over the news for his inflammatory opinions about abortion. But the controversy stemmed from <em>Practical Ethics</em> — a book he’d actually released way back in 1979. It took a German translation ten years on for protests to kick off. <br><br>

According to Singer, he honestly didn’t expect this view to be as provocative as it became, and he certainly wasn’t aiming to stir up trouble and get attention. <br><br>

But after the protests and the increasing coverage of his work in German media, the previously flat sales of <a href="https://80k.link/pebook"><b>Practical Ethics</b></a> shot up. And the negative attention he received ultimately led him to a weekly opinion column in <i>The New York Times</i>. <br><br>

<b>• Singer's book <em>The Life You Can Save</em> has just been re-released as a 10th anniversary edition, available as a free e-book and audiobook, read by a range of celebrities. <a href="https://80k.link/tlycsbook">Get it here</a>.</b><br>
<b>•&nbsp;<a href="https://80k.link/singerinterview">Links to learn more, summary and full transcript</a>.</b><br><br>

Singer points out that as a result of this increased attention, many more people also read the rest of the book — which includes chapters with a real ability to do good, covering global poverty, animal ethics, and other important topics.

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1989, the professor of moral philosophy Peter Singer was all over the news for his inflammatory opinions about abortion. But the controversy stemmed from <em>Practical Ethics</em> — a book he’d actually released way back in 1979. It took a German translation ten years on for protests to kick off. <br><br>

According to Singer, he honestly didn’t expect this view to be as provocative as it became, and he certainly wasn’t aiming to stir up trouble and get attention. <br><br>

But after the protests and the increasing coverage of his work in German media, the previously flat sales of <a href="https://80k.link/pebook"><b>Practical Ethics</b></a> shot up. And the negative attention he received ultimately led him to a weekly opinion column in <i>The New York Times</i>. <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<em>"…it started when the Soviet Union fell apart and there was a real desire to ensure security of nuclear materials and pathogens, and that scientists with [WMD-related] knowledge could get paid so that they wouldn't go to countries and sell that knowledge." </em><br><br>

Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins has had an incredible career in diplomacy and global security. <br><br>

Today she’s a nonresident senior fellow at the <i>Brookings Institution</i> and president of <i>Global Connections Empowering Global Change</i>, where she works on global health, infectious disease and defence innovation. In 2017 she founded her own nonprofit, the <i>Women of Color Advancing Peace, Security and Conflict Transformation</i> (WCAPS). <br><br>

But in this interview we focus on her time as Ambassador at the <i>U.S. Department of State</i> under the Obama administration, where she worked for eight years as Coordinator for Threat Reduction Programs in the <i>Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation</i>. <br><br>

In that role, Bonnie coordinated the Department of State’s work to prevent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorism with programmes funded by other U.S. departments and agencies, and as well as other countries. <br><br>

• <b>Having trouble with podcast 'chapters' on this episode? Please report any problems to keiran at 80000hours dot org.</b> <br><br>

What was it like to be an ambassador focusing on an issue, rather than an ambassador of a country? Bonnie says the travel was exhausting. She could find herself in Africa one week, and Indonesia the next. She’d meet with folks going to New York for meetings at the UN one day, then hold her own meetings at the White House the next. <br><br>

Each event would have a distinct purpose. For one, she’d travel to Germany as a US Representative, talking about why the two countries should extend their partnership. For another, she could visit the <i>Food and Agriculture Organization</i> to talk about why they need to think more about biosecurity issues. No day was like the previous one. <br><br>

Bonnie was also a leading U.S. official in the launch and implementation of the <i>Global Health Security Agenda</i> discussed at length <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-inglesby-health-security/">in episode 27</a>. <br><br>

Before returning to government in 2009, Bonnie served as program officer for U.S. Foreign and Security Policy at the <i>Ford Foundation</i>. She also served as counsel on the <i>9/11 Commission</i>. Bonnie was the lead staff member conducting research, interviews, and preparing commission reports on counterterrorism policies in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and on U.S. military plans targeting al-Qaeda before 9/11. <br><br>

And as if that all weren't curious enough four years ago Bonnie decided to go vegan. We talk about her work so far as well as: <br><br>

• How listeners can start a career like hers <br>
• Mistakes made by Mr Obama and Mr Trump <br>• Networking, the value of attention, and being a vegan in DC <br>
• And 2020 Presidential candidates.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<b>November 3 2020, 10:32PM:</b> CNN, NBC, and FOX report that Donald Trump has narrowly won Florida, and with it, re-election.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>

<b>November 3 2020, 11:46PM:</b> The NY Times and Wall Street Journal report that some group has successfully hacked electronic voting systems across the country, including Florida. The malware has spread to tens of thousands of machines and deletes any record of its activity, so the returning officer of Florida concedes they actually have no idea who won the state — and don't see how they can figure it out. <br><br>

What on Earth happens next? <br><br>

Today’s guest — world-renowned computer security expert Bruce Schneier — thinks this scenario is plausible, and the ensuing chaos would sow so much distrust that half the country would never accept the election result. <br><br>

Unfortunately the US has no recovery system for a situation like this, unlike Parliamentary democracies, which can just rerun the election a few weeks later.<p></p><p>

•  <a href="https://80k.link/schneier-sn"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br>
•  Motivating article: <a href="https://80k.link/iscfgcrr"><b>Information security careers for global catastrophic risk reduction</b></a> by Zabel and Muehlhauser</p><p>

The constitution says the state legislature decides, and they can do so however they like; one tied local election in Texas was settled by playing a hand of poker. <br><br>

Elections serve two purposes. The first is the obvious one: to pick a winner. The second, but equally important, is to convince the loser to go along with it — which is why hacks often focus on convincing the losing side that the election wasn't fair. <br><br>

Schneier thinks there's a need to agree how this situation should be handled before something like it happens, and America falls into severe infighting as everyone tries to turn the situation to their political advantage. <br><br>

And to fix our voting systems, we urgently need two things: a voter-verifiable paper ballot and risk-limiting audits. <br><br>

According to Schneier, computer security experts look at current electronic voting machines and can barely believe their eyes. But voting machine designers never understand the security weakness of what they're designing, because they have a bureaucrat's rather than a hacker's mindset. <br><br>

The ideal computer security expert walks into a shop and thinks, "You know, here's how I would shoplift." They automatically see where the cameras are, whether there are alarms, and where the security guards aren't watching. <br><br>

In this episode we discuss this hacker mindset, and how to use a career in security to protect democracy and guard dangerous secrets from people who shouldn't get access to them.</p><p><br>

We also cover: <br><br>

• How can we have surveillance of dangerous actors, without falling back into authoritarianism? <br>
• When if ever should information about weaknesses in society's security be kept secret? <br>
• How secure are nuclear weapons systems around the world? <br>
• How worried should we be about deep-fakes? <br>• Schneier’s critiques of blockchain technology <br>
• How technologists should be vital in shaping policy <br>
• What are the most consequential computer security problems today? <br>
• Could a career in information security be very useful for reducing global catastrophic risks? <br>
• And more.</p><p><br>

What on Earth happens next? <br><br>

Today’s guest — world-renowned computer security expert Bruce Schneier — thinks this scenario is plausible, and the ensuing chaos would sow so much distrust that half the country would never accept the election result. <br><br>

Unfortunately the US has no recovery system for a situation like this, unlike Parliamentary democracies, which can just rerun the election a few weeks later.<p></p><p>

The constitution says the state legislature decides, and they can do so however they like; one tied local election in Texas was settled by playing a hand of poker. <br><br>

Elections serve two purposes. The first is the obvious one: to pick a winner. The second, but equally important, is to convince the loser to go along with it — which is why hacks often focus on convincing the losing side that the election wasn't fair. <br><br>

Schneier thinks there's a need to agree how this situation should be handled before something like it happens, and America falls into severe infighting as everyone tries to turn the situation to their political advantage. <br><br>

And to fix our voting systems, we urgently need two things: a voter-verifiable paper ballot and risk-limiting audits. <br><br>

According to Schneier, computer security experts look at current electronic voting machines and can barely believe their eyes. But voting machine designers never understand the security weakness of what they're designing, because they have a bureaucrat's rather than a hacker's mindset. <br><br>

The ideal computer security expert walks into a shop and thinks, "You know, here's how I would shoplift." They automatically see where the cameras are, whether there are alarms, and where the security guards aren't watching. <br><br>

In this episode we discuss this hacker mindset, and how to use a career in security to protect democracy and guard dangerous secrets from people who shouldn't get access to them.</p><p><br>

We also cover: <br><br>

• How can we have surveillance of dangerous actors, without falling back into authoritarianism? <br>
• When if ever should information about weaknesses in society's security be kept secret? <br>
• How secure are nuclear weapons systems around the world? <br>
• How worried should we be about deep-fakes? <br>• Schneier’s critiques of blockchain technology <br>
• How technologists should be vital in shaping policy <br>
• What are the most consequential computer security problems today? <br>
• Could a career in information security be very useful for reducing global catastrophic risks? <br>
• And more.</p><p><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Today's episode is a compilation of interviews I recently recorded for two other shows, <i>Love Your Work</i> and <i>The Neoliberal Podcast</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>

If you've listened to absolutely everything on this podcast feed, you'll have heard four interviews with me already, but fortunately I don't think these two include much repetition, and I've gotten a decent amount of positive feedback on both.&nbsp;<br><br>

First up, I speak with David Kadavy on his show,&nbsp;<a href="https://kadavy.net/blog/archive/love-your-work/"><b>Love Your Work</b></a>.&nbsp;<br><br>

This is a particularly personal and relaxed interview. We talk about all sorts of things, including nicotine gum, plastic straw bans, whether recycling is important, how many lives a doctor saves, why interviews should go for at least 2 hours, how athletes doping could be good for the world, and many other fun topics.&nbsp;<br><br>

<p>• Our <b>annual impact survey</b> is about to close — I'd really appreciate if you could <b><a href="https://80k.link/isrw">take 3–10 minutes to fill it out now</a>.&nbsp;</b><br>
• <a href="https://80000hours.org/2019/09/rob-wiblin-on-many-things/"><b>The blog post</b></a> about this episode.<br><br>

At some points we even actually discuss effective altruism and 80,000 Hours, but you can easily skip through those bits if they feel too familiar.&nbsp;<br><br>

The second interview is with Jeremiah Johnson on the <a href="https://neoliberalproject.org/podcast"><b>Neoliberal Podcast</b></a>. It starts 2 hours and 15 minutes into this recording.&nbsp;<br><br>

Neoliberalism <a href="https://medium.com/@s8mb/im-a-neoliberal-maybe-you-are-too-b809a2a588d6"><b>in the sense used by this show</b></a> is not the free market fundamentalism you might associate with the term. Rather it's a centrist or even centre-left view that supports things like social liberalism, multilateral international institutions, trade, high rates of migration, racial justice, inclusive institutions, financial redistribution, prioritising the global poor, market urbanism, and environmental sustainability.&nbsp;<br><br>

This is the more demanding of the two conversations, as listeners to that show have already heard of effective altruism, so we were able to get the best arguments Jeremiah could offer against focusing on improving the long term future of the world.&nbsp;<br><br>

Jeremiah is more of a fan of donating to evidence-backed global health charities recommended by GiveWell, and does so himself.&nbsp;<br><br>

I appreciate him having done his homework and forcing me to do my best to explain how well my views can stand up to counterarguments. It was a challenge for me to paint the whole picture in the half an hour we spent on longterm and I expect there's answers in there which will be fresh even for regular listeners.&nbsp;<br><br>

I hope you enjoy both conversations! Feel free to email me with any feedback.<br><br>

Or follow our pages on Facebook and Twitter.&amp;nbsp; ——&amp;nbsp; Once a year 80,000 Hours runs a survey to find out whether we've helped our users have a larger social impact with their life and career.&amp;nbsp; We and our donors need to know whether our services, like this podcast, are helping people enough to continue them or scale them up, and it's only by hearing from you that we can make these decisions in a sensible way.&amp;nbsp; So, if 80,000 Hours' podcast, job board, articles, headhunting, advising or other projects have somehow contributed to your life or career plans, please take 3–10 minutes to let us know how.&amp;nbsp; You can also let us know where we've fallen short, which helps us fix problems with what we're doing.&amp;nbsp; We've refreshed the survey this year, hopefully making it easier to fill out than in the past.&amp;nbsp; We'll keep this appeal up for about two weeks, but if you fill it out now that means you definitely won't forget!&amp;nbsp; Thanks so much, and talk to you again in a normal episode soon.&amp;nbsp; — Rob Tag for internal use: this RSS feed is originating in BackTracks.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>career,advice,social,impact,80000,Hours</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>https://80000hours.org/impact-survey/?utm_campaign=podcast__impact-survey-appeal&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/80000HoursPodcast/~5/Rm-UPK-zVj4/impact-survey-appeal-and-things-80k-does-sep-2019.mp3" length="3500325" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>https://backtracks.fm/80000hours/pr/63cde496-d8b7-11e9-a35e-0e0bd6f362e0/impact-survey-appeal-and-things-80k-does-sep-2019.mp3?s=1&amp;sd=1&amp;u=1574955509</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>Historically, progress in the field of cryptography has had <a href="https://80k.link/garfinkel">major consequences</a>. It has changed the course of major wars, made it possible to do business on the internet, and enabled private communication between both law-abiding citizens and dangerous criminals. Could it have similarly significant consequences in future?<br><br>

Today's guest — Vitalik Buterin — is world-famous as the lead developer of Ethereum, a successor to the cryptographic-currency Bitcoin, which added the capacity for smart contracts and decentralised organisations. Buterin first proposed Ethereum at the age of 20, and by the age of 23 its success had likely made him a billionaire.<br><br>

At the same time, far from indulging hype about these so-called 'blockchain' technologies, he has been candid about the limited good accomplished by Bitcoin and other currencies developed using cryptographic tools — and the breakthroughs that will be needed before they can have a meaningful social impact. In his own words, *"blockchains as they currently exist are in many ways a joke, right?"*<br><br>

But Buterin is not just a realist. He's also an idealist, who has been helping to advance big ideas for new social institutions that might help people better coordinate to pursue their shared goals.<br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/buterin"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

By combining theories in economics and mechanism design with advances in cryptography, he has been pioneering the new interdiscriplinary field of 'cryptoeconomics'. Economist Tyler Cowen has<a href="https://80k.link/tyler-buterin">observed that</a>, <em>"at 25, Vitalik appears to repeatedly rediscover important economics results from famous papers, without knowing about the papers at all."</em><br><br> 

Along with <a href="https://80k.link/weyl-buterin">previous guest Glen Weyl</a>, Buterin has helped develop a model for so-called <a href="https://80k.link/qf">'quadratic funding'</a>, which in principle could transform the provision of 'public goods'. That is, goods that people benefit from whether they help pay for them or not.<br><br>

Examples of goods that are fully or partially 'public goods' include sound decision-making in government, international peace, scientific advances, disease control, the existence of smart journalism, preventing climate change, deflecting asteroids headed to Earth, and the elimination of suffering. Their underprovision in part reflects the difficulty of getting people to pay for anything when they can instead free-ride on the efforts of others. Anything that could reduce this failure of coordination might transform the world.<br><br>

But these and other related proposals face major hurdles. They're vulnerable to collusion, might be used to fund scams, and remain untested at a small scale — not to mention that anything with a square root sign in it is going to struggle to achieve societal legitimacy. Is the prize large enough to justify efforts to overcome these challenges?<br><br>

In today's extensive three-hour interview, Buterin and I cover:<br><br>

• What the blockchain has accomplished so far, and what it might achieve in the next decade;<br>
• Why many social problems can be viewed as a coordination failure to provide a public good;<br>
• Whether any of the ideas for decentralised social systems emerging from the blockchain community could really work;<br>
• His view of 'effective altruism' and 'long-termism';<br>
• Why he is optimistic about 'quadratic funding', but pessimistic about replacing existing voting with <a href="https://80k.link/qv">'quadratic voting'</a>;<br>
• Why humanity might have to abandon living in cities;<br>

         <description><![CDATA[Imagine that – one day – humanity dies out. At some point, many millions of years later, intelligent life might well evolve again. Is there any message we could leave that would reliably help them out?<br><br>

In his second appearance on the 80,000 Hours Podcast, machine learning researcher and polymath Paul Christiano suggests we try to answer this question with a related thought experiment: are there any messages we might want to send back to our ancestors in the year 1700 that would have made history likely to go in a better direction than it did? It seems there probably are.<br><br>

• <a href="https://80k.link/christiano-2"><b>Links to learn more, summary, and full transcript.</b></a><br>
• <a href="https://80k.link/christiano-1"><b>Paul's first appearance on the show in episode 44.</b></a><br>
• <a href="https://80k.link/christiano-outtake"><b>An out-take on decision theory.</b></a><br><br>

We could tell them hard-won lessons from history; mention some research questions we wish we'd started addressing earlier; hand over all the social science we have that fosters peace and cooperation; and at the same time steer clear of engineering hints that would speed up the development of dangerous weapons.<br><br>

But, as <a href="https://sideways-view.com/2018/06/07/messages-to-the-future/">Christiano points out</a>, even if we could satisfactorily figure out what we'd like to be able to tell our ancestors, that's just the first challenge. We'd need to leave the message somewhere that they could identify and dig up. While there are some promising options, this turns out to be remarkably hard to do, as anything we put on the Earth's surface quickly gets buried far underground.<br><br>

But even if we figure out a satisfactory message, <em>and</em> a ways to ensure it's found, a civilization this far in the future won't speak any language like our own. And being another species, they presumably won't share as many fundamental concepts with us as humans from 1700. If we knew a way to leave them thousands of books and pictures in a material that wouldn't break down, would they be able to decipher what we meant to tell them, or would it simply remain a mystery?<br><br>

That's just one of many playful questions discussed in today's episode with Christiano — a frequent writer who's willing to brave questions that others find too strange or hard to grapple with.<br><br>

We also talk about why <a href="https://sideways-view.com/2019/05/25/analyzing-divestment/">divesting</a> a little bit from harmful companies might be more useful than I'd been thinking. Or whether creatine might make us a bit smarter, and carbon dioxide filled conference rooms make us a lot stupider.<br><br>

Finally, we get a big update on progress in machine learning and efforts to make sure it's reliably aligned with our goals, which is Paul's main research project. He responds to the views that DeepMind's Pushmeet Kohli espoused <a href="https://80k.link/pushmeet-kohli">in a previous episode</a>, and we discuss whether we'd be better off if AI progress turned out to be most limited by algorithmic insights, or by our ability to manufacture enough computer processors.<br><br>

Some other issues that come up along the way include:<br><br>

• Are there any supplements people can take that make them think better?<br>
• What implications do our views on meta-ethics have for aligning AI with our goals?<br>
• Is there much of a risk that the future will contain anything optimised for causing harm?<br>
• An <a href="https://80k.link/christiano-outtake">out-take about the implications of decision theory</a>, which we decided was too confusing and confused to stay in the main recording.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>From 1870 to 1950, the introduction of electricity transformed life in the US and UK, as people gained access to lighting, radio and a wide range of household appliances for the first time. Electricity turned out to be a general purpose technology that could help with almost everything people did.<br><br>

Some think this is the best historical analogy we have for how machine learning could alter life in the 21st century.<br><br>

In addition to massively changing everyday life, past general purpose technologies have also changed the nature of war. For example, when electricity was introduced to the battlefield, commanders gained the ability to communicate quickly with units in the field over great distances.<br><br>

How might international security be altered if the impact of machine learning reaches a similar scope to that of electricity? Today's guest — Helen Toner — recently helped found the <em>Center for Security and Emerging Technology</em> at Georgetown University to help policymakers prepare for such disruptive technical changes that might threaten international peace.<br><br>

Their behaviour is so frustrating because accurately predicting the future is central to every action we take. If we can't assess the likelihood of different outcomes we're in a complete bind, whether the decision concerns war and peace, work and study, or Black Mirror and RuPaul's Drag Race.<br><br>

Which is why the research of Professor Philip Tetlock is relevant for all of us each and every day.<br><br>

He has spent 40 years as a meticulous social scientist, collecting millions of predictions from tens of thousands of people, in order to figure out how good humans really are at foreseeing the future, and what habits of thought allow us to do better.<br><br>

Along with other psychologists, he identified that many ordinary people are attracted to a 'folk probability' that draws just three distinctions — 'impossible', 'possible' and 'certain' — and which leads to major systemic mistakes. But with the right mindset and training we can become capable of accurately discriminating between differences as fine as 56% as against 57% likely.<br><br>

In the aftermath of Iraq and WMDs the US intelligence community hired him to prevent the same ever happening again, and his guide — <i>Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</i> — became a bestseller back in 2014.<br><br>

That was five years ago. In today's interview, Tetlock explains how his research agenda continues to advance, today using the game <i>Civilization 5</i> to see how well we can predict what <i>would have</i>&nbsp;happened in elusive counterfactual worlds we never get to see, and discovering how simple algorithms can complement or substitute for human judgement.<br><br>

We discuss how his work can be applied to your personal life to answer high-stakes questions, like how likely you are to thrive in a given career path, or whether your business idea will be a billion-dollar unicorn — or fall apart catastrophically.

And we find out what jobs people can take to make improving the reasonableness of decision-making in major institutions that shape the world their profession, as it has been for Tetlock over many decades.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>It can often feel hopeless to be an activist seeking social change on an obscure issue where most people seem opposed or at best indifferent to you. But according to a new book by Professor Cass Sunstein, they shouldn't despair. Large social changes are often abrupt and unexpected, arising in an environment of seeming public opposition.<br><br>

The Communist Revolution in Russia spread so swiftly it confounded even Lenin. Seventy years later the Soviet Union collapsed just as quickly and unpredictably.<br><br>

In the modern era we have gay marriage, #metoo and the Arab Spring, as well as nativism, Euroskepticism and Hindu nationalism.<br><br>

How can a society that so recently seemed to support the status quo bring about change in years, months, or even weeks?<br><br>

Sunstein — co-author of <i>Nudge</i>, Obama White House official, and by far the most cited legal scholar of the late 2000s — aims to unravel the mystery and figure out the implications in his new book <i>How Change Happens</i>.<br><br>

He pulls together three phenomena which social scientists have studied in recent decades: <i>preference falsification</i>, <i>variable thresholds for action</i>, and <i>group polarisation</i>. If Sunstein is to be believed, together these are a cocktail for social shifts that are chaotic and fundamentally unpredictable.<br><br>

In brief, people constantly misrepresent their true views, even to close friends and family. They themselves aren't quite sure how socially acceptable their feelings would have to become, before they revealed them, or joined a campaign for social change. And a chance meeting between a few strangers can be the spark that radicalises a handful of people, who then find a message that can spread their views to millions.<br><br>

According to Sunstein, it's <i>"much, much easier"</i> to create social change when large numbers of people secretly or latently agree with you. But 'preference falsification' is so pervasive that it's no simple matter to figure out when that's the case.<br><br>

In today's interview, we debate with Sunstein whether this model of cultural change is accurate, and if so, what lessons it has for those who would like to shift the world in a more humane direction. We discuss:<br><br>

• How much people misrepresent their views in democratic countries.<br>
• Whether the finding that groups with an existing view tend towards a more extreme position would stand up in the replication crisis.<br>
• When is it justified to encourage your own group to polarise?<br>
• Sunstein's difficult experiences as a pioneer of animal rights law.<br>
• Whether activists can do better by spending half their resources on public opinion surveys.<br>
• Should people be more or less outspoken about their true views?<br>

• How can we learn about social movements that failed and disappeared?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[When you're building a bridge, responsibility for making sure it won't fall over isn't handed over to a few 'bridge not falling down engineers'. Making sure a bridge is safe to use and remains standing in a storm is completely central to the design, and indeed the entire project.<br><br>

When it comes to artificial intelligence, commentators often distinguish between enhancing the capabilities of machine learning systems and enhancing their safety. But to Pushmeet Kohli, principal scientist and research team leader at DeepMind, research to make AI robust and reliable is no more a side-project in AI design than keeping a bridge standing is a side-project in bridge design.<br><br>

Far from being an overhead on the 'real' work, it’s an essential part of making AI systems work at all. We don’t want AI systems to be out of alignment with our intentions, and that consideration must arise throughout their development.<br><br>

Professor Stuart Russell — co-author of the most popular AI textbook — <a href="https://youtu.be/GYQrNfSmQ0M?t=2651">has gone as far as to suggest</a> that if this view is right, it may be time to retire the term ‘AI safety research’ altogether.<br><br>

With the goal of designing systems that are reliably consistent with desired specifications, DeepMind have <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/robust-and-verified-ai/">recently published work</a> on important technical challenges for the machine learning community.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[This is a cross-post of some interviews Rob did recently on two other podcasts — <a href="https://mission.org/missiondaily/">Mission Daily</a>&nbsp;(from 2m) and <a href="https://goodlifepodcast.podbean.com/">The Good Life</a>&nbsp;(from 1h13m).<br><br>

Some of the content will be familiar to regular listeners — but if you’re at all interested in Rob’s personal thoughts, there should be quite a lot of new material to make listening worthwhile.<br><br>

The first interview is with Chad Grills. They focused largely on new technologies and existential risks, but also discuss topics like:<br><br>

• Why Rob is wary of fiction<br>
• Egalitarianism in the evolution of hunter gatherers<br>
• How to stop social media screwing up politics<br>
• Careers in government versus business<br><br>

The second interview is with Prof Andrew Leigh - the Shadow Assistant Treasurer in Australia. This one gets into more personal topics than we usually cover on the show, like: <br><br>

• What advice would Rob give to his teenage self?<br>
• Which person has most shaped Rob’s view of living an ethical life?<br>
• Rob’s approach to giving to the homeless<br>
• What does Rob do to maximise his own happiness?<br><br>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a cross-post of some interviews Rob did recently on two other podcasts — <a href="https://mission.org/missiondaily/">Mission Daily</a>&nbsp;(from 2m) and <a href="https://goodlifepodcast.podbean.com/">The Good Life</a>&nbsp;(from 1h13m).<br><br>

Some of the content will be familiar to regular listeners — but if you’re at all interested in Rob’s personal thoughts, there should be quite a lot of new material to make listening worthwhile.<br><br>

The first interview is with Chad Grills. They focused largely on new technologies and existential risks, but also discuss topics like:<br><br>

• Why Rob is wary of fiction<br>
• Egalitarianism in the evolution of hunter gatherers<br>
• How to stop social media screwing up politics<br>
• Careers in government versus business<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[You’re 29 years old, and you’ve just been given a job in the White House. How do you quickly figure out how the US Executive Branch behemoth actually works, so that you can have as much impact as possible - before you quit or get kicked out?<br><br>

That was the challenge put in front of Tom Kalil in 1993.<br><br>

He had enough success to last a full 16 years inside the Clinton and Obama administrations, working to foster the development of the internet, then nanotechnology, and then cutting-edge brain modelling, among other things.<br><br>

But not everyone figures out how to move the needle. In today's interview, Tom shares his experience with how to increase your chances of getting an influential role in government, and how to make the most of the opportunity if you get in.<br><br>

</a><a href="https://80k.link/tom-kalil-job-board"><b>Our high-impact job board, which features other related opportunities.</b></a><br><br>

He believes that Congressional gridlock leads people to greatly underestimate how much the Executive Branch can and does do on its own every day. Decisions by individuals change how billions of dollars are spent; regulations are enforced, and then suddenly they aren't; and a single sentence in the State of the Union can get civil servants to pay attention to a topic that would otherwise go ignored.<br><br>

Over years at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 'Team Kalil' built up a white board of principles. For example, 'the schedule is your friend': setting a meeting date with the President can force people to finish something, where they otherwise might procrastinate.<br><br>

Or 'talk to who owns the paper'. People would wonder how Tom could get so many lines into the President's speeches. The answer was "figure out who's writing the speech, find them with the document, and tell them to add the line." Obvious, but not something most were doing.<br><br>

Not everything is a precise operation though. Tom also tells us the story of NetDay, a project that was put together at the last minute because the President incorrectly believed it was already organised – and decided he was going to announce it in person.<br><br>

In today's episode we get down to nuts &amp; bolts, and discuss:<br><br>

• How did Tom spin work on a primary campaign into a job in the next White House?<br>
• Why does Tom think hiring is the most important work he did, and how did he decide who to bring onto the team?<br>
• How do you get people to do things when you don't have formal power over them?<br>
• What roles in the US government are most likely to help with the long-term future, or reducing existential risks?<br>
• Is it possible, or even desirable, to get the general public interested in abstract, long-term policy ideas?<br>
• What are 'policy entrepreneurs' and why do they matter?<br>
• What is the role for prizes in promoting science and technology? What are other promising policy ideas?<br>
• Why you can get more done by not taking credit.<br>
• What can the White House do if an agency isn't doing what it wants?<br>
• How can the effective altruism community improve the maturity of our policy recommendations?<br>
• How much can talented individuals accomplish during a short-term stay in government?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Elephants in chains at travelling circuses; pregnant pigs trapped in coffin sized crates at factory farms; deers living in the wild. We should welcome the last as a pleasant break from the horror, right?<br><br>

Maybe, but maybe not. While we tend to have a romanticised view of nature, life in the wild includes a range of extremely negative experiences. <br><br>

Many animals are hunted by predators, and constantly have to remain vigilant about the risk of being killed, and perhaps experiencing the horror of being eaten alive. Resource competition often leads to chronic hunger or starvation. Their diseases and injuries are never treated. In winter animals freeze to death; in droughts they die of heat or thirst. <br><br>

There are fewer than 20 people in the world dedicating their lives to researching these problems.<br><br>

But according to Persis Eskander, researcher at the Open Philanthropy Project, if we sum up the negative experiences of all wild animals, their sheer number could make the scale of the problem larger than most other near-term concerns.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/persis-eskander-wild-animal-welfare/?utm_campaign=podcast__persis-eskander&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

Persis urges us to recognise that nature isn’t inherently good or bad, but rather the result of an amoral evolutionary process. For those that can't survive the brutal indifference of their environment, life is often a series of bad experiences, followed by an even worse death.<br><br>

But should we actually intervene? How do we know what animals are sentient? How often do animals feel hunger, cold, fear, happiness, satisfaction, boredom, and intense agony? Are there long-term technologies that could eventually allow us to massively improve wild animal welfare?<br><br>

For most of these big questions, the answer is: we don’t know. And Persis thinks we're far away from knowing enough to start interfering with ecosystems. But that's all the more reason to start looking at these questions.<br><br> 

There are <em>some</em> concrete steps we could take today, like improving the way wild caught fish are slaughtered. Fish might lack the charisma of a lion or the intelligence of a pig, but if they have the capacity to suffer — and evidence suggests that they do — we should be thinking of ways to kill them painlessly rather than allowing them to suffocate to death over hours.<br><br>

In today’s interview we explore wild animal welfare as a new field of research, and discuss:<br><br>

• Do we have a moral duty towards wild animals or not?<br>
• How should we measure the number of wild animals?<br>
• What are some key activities that generate a lot of suffering or pleasure for wild animals that people might not fully appreciate?<br>
• Is there a danger in imagining how we as humans would feel if we were put into their situation?<br>
• Should we eliminate parasites and predators?<br>
• How important are insects?<br>
• How strongly should we focus on just avoiding humans going in and making things worse?<br>
• How does this compare to work on farmed animal suffering?<br>
• The most compelling arguments for humanity not dedicating resources to wild animal welfare<br>
• Is there much of a case for the idea that this work could improve the very long-term future of humanity?<br><br>

Rob is then joined by two of his colleagues — Niel Bowerman and Michelle Hutchinson — to quickly discuss:<br><br>

• The importance of figuring out your values<br>
• Chemistry, psychology, and other different paths towards working on wild animal welfare<br>
• How to break into new fields<br><br>

There are some concrete steps we could take today, like improving the way wild caught fish are slaughtered. Fish might lack the charisma of a lion or the intelligence of a pig, but if they have the capacity to suffer — and evidence suggests that they do — we should be thinking of ways to kill them painlessly rather than allowing them to suffocate to death over hours. In today’s interview we explore wild animal welfare as a new field of research, and discuss: • Do we have a moral duty towards wild animals or not? • How should we measure the number of wild animals? • What are some key activities that generate a lot of suffering or pleasure for wild animals that people might not fully appreciate? • Is there a danger in imagining how we as humans would feel if we were put into their situation? • Should we eliminate parasites and predators? • How important are insects? • How strongly should we focus on just avoiding humans going in and making things worse? • How does this compare to work on farmed animal suffering? • The most compelling arguments for humanity not dedicating resources to wild animal welfare • Is there much of a case for the idea that this work could improve the very long-term future of humanity? Rob is then joined by two of his colleagues — Niel Bowerman and Michelle Hutchinson — to quickly discuss: • The importance of figuring out your values • Chemistry, psychology, and other different paths towards working on wild animal welfare • How to break into new fields Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world’s most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app. The 80,000 Hours Podcast is produced by Keiran Harris.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>career,advice,social,impact,80000,Hours</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/persis-eskander-wild-animal-welfare/?utm_campaign=podcast__persis-eskander&amp;utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&amp;utm_medium=podcast</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/80000HoursPodcast/~5/WvY7Hzma2Es/56---persis-eskander-on-improving-wild-animal-welfare.mp3" length="170846633" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>https://backtracks.fm/80000hours/pr/499b38b8-5f99-11e9-8ce5-0e280b71e04c/56---persis-eskander-on-improving-wild-animal-welfare.mp3?s=1&amp;sd=1&amp;u=1555348996</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

Policy change quickly took China from famine to fortune; Singapore from swamps to skyscrapers; and Hong Kong from fishing village to financial centre. Unfortunately, many governments are hard to reform and — to put it mildly — it's not easy to found a new country.<br><br>

This has prompted poverty-fighters and political dreamers to look for creative ways to get new and better 'pseudo-countries' off the ground. The poor could then voluntary migrate to in search of security and prosperity. And innovators would be free to experiment with new political and legal systems without having to impose their ideas on existing jurisdictions. <br><br>

The 'seasteading movement' imagined founding new self-governing cities on the sea, but obvious challenges have kept that one on the drawing board. Nobel Prize winner and World Bank President Paul Romer suggested 'charter cities', where a host country would volunteer for another country with better legal institutions to effectively govern some of its territory. But that idea too ran aground for political, practical and personal reasons.<br><br>

Now Mark Lutter and Tamara Winter, of <em>The Center for Innovative Governance Research</em> (CIGR), are reviving the idea of 'charter cities', with some modifications. Gone is the idea of transferring sovereignty. Instead these cities would look more like the 'special economic zones' that worked miracles for Taiwan and China among others. But rather than keep the rest of the country's rules with a few pieces removed, they hope to start from scratch, opting in to the laws they want to keep, in order to leap forward to "best practices in commercial law."<br><br>

<b><a href="https://80k.link/rob-on-the-good-life">Rob on <em>The Good Life: Andrew Leigh in Conversation</em> — on 'making the most of your 80,000 hours'.</a></b><br><br>

The project has quickly gotten attention, with Mark and Tamara <a href="https://80k.link/lutter-emergent">receiving funding from Tyler Cowen's Emergent Ventures</a> (discussed in episode 45) and winning a <a href="https://pioneer.app/blog/meet-the-pioneers-take-3/">Pioneer tournament</a>.<br><br>

Starting afresh with a new city makes it possible to clear away thousands of harmful rules without having to fight each of the thousands of interest groups that will viciously defend their privileges. Initially the city can fund infrastructure and public services by gradually selling off its land, which appreciates as the city flourishes. And with 40 million people relocating to cities every year, there are plenty of prospective migrants.<br><br>

<em>CIGR</em> is fleshing out how these arrangements would work, advocating for them, and developing supporting services that make it easier for any jurisdiction to implement. They're currently in the process of influencing a new prospective satellite city in Zambia.<br><br>

Of course, one can raise many criticisms of this idea: Is it likely to be taken up? Is CIGR really doing the right things to make it happen? Will it really reduce poverty if it is?<br><br>

We discuss those questions, as well as:<br><br>

• How did Mark get a new organisation off the ground, with fundraising and other staff?<br>
• What made China's 'special economic zones' so successful?<br>
• What are the biggest challenges in getting new cities off the ground?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/">Dactyl</a> is an AI system that can manipulate objects with a human-like robot hand. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/">OpenAI Five</a> is an AI system that can defeat humans at the video game Dota 2. The strange thing is they were both developed using the same general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm.<br><br>

How is this possible and what does it show?<br><br>

In today's interview Jack Clark, Policy Director at OpenAI, explains that from a computational perspective using a hand and playing Dota 2 are remarkably similar problems.<br><br>

A robot hand needs to hold an object, move its fingers, and rotate it to the desired position. In Dota 2 you control a team of several different people, moving them around a map to attack an enemy. <br><br>

Your hand has 20 or 30 different joints to move. The number of main actions in Dota 2 is 10 to 20, as you move your characters around a map.<br><br>

When you’re rotating an objecting in your hand, you sense its friction, but you don’t directly perceive the entire shape of the object. In Dota 2, you're unable to see the entire map and perceive what's there by moving around&nbsp;– metaphorically 'touching' the space.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<i>“Politics. Business. Opinion. Science. Sports. Animal welfare. Existential risk.”</i> Is this a plausible future lineup for major news outlets?<br><br>

Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and given very little editorial direction, Vox's <i><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect">Future Perfect</a></i>&nbsp;aspires to be more or less that.<br><br>

Competition in the news business creates pressure to write quick pieces on topical political issues that can drive lots of clicks with just a few hours' work.<br><br>

But according to Kelsey Piper, staff writer for this new section of Vox's website focused on effective altruist themes, <i>Future Perfect's</i>&nbsp;goal is to run in the opposite direction and make room for more substantive coverage that's not tied to the news cycle.<br><br>

They hope that in the long-term talented writers from other outlets across the political spectrum can also be attracted to tackle these topics.<br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/kelsey-piper"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/kelsey-piper-links"><b>Links to Kelsey's top articles.</b></a><br><br>

Some skeptics of the project have questioned whether this general coverage of global catastrophic risks actually helps reduce them.<br><br>

Kelsey responds: if you decide to dedicate your life to AI safety research, what’s the likely reaction from your family and friends? Do they think of you as someone about to join <i>"that weird Silicon Valley apocalypse thing"</i>? Or do they, having read about the issues widely, simply think <i>“Oh, yeah. That seems important. I'm glad you're working on it.”</i><br><br>

Kelsey believes that really matters, and is determined by broader coverage of these kinds of topics.<br><br>

If that's right, is journalism a plausible pathway for doing the most good with your career, or did Kelsey just get particularly lucky? After all, journalism is a shrinking industry without an obvious revenue model to fund many writers looking into the world's most pressing problems.<br><br>

Kelsey points out that one needn't take the risk of committing to journalism at an early age. Instead listeners can specialise in an important topic, while leaving open the option of switching into specialist journalism later on, should a great opportunity happen to present itself.<br><br>

In today’s episode we discuss that path, as well as:<br><br>

• What’s the day to day life of a Vox journalist like?<br>
• How can good journalism get funded?<br>
• Are there meaningful tradeoffs between doing what's in the interest of Vox and doing what’s good?<br>
• How concerned should we be about the risk of effective altruism being perceived as partisan?<br>
• How well can short articles effectively communicate complicated ideas?<br>
• Are there alternative business models that could fund high quality journalism on a larger scale?<br>
• How do you approach the case for taking AI seriously to a broader audience?<br>
• How valuable might it be for media outlets to do Tetlock-style forecasting?<br>
• Is it really a good idea to heavily tax billionaires?<br>
• How do you avoid the pressure to get clicks?<br>
• How possible is it to predict which articles are going to be popular?<br>
• How did Kelsey build the skills necessary to work at Vox?<br>
• General lessons for people dealing with very difficult life circumstances<br><br>

Rob is then joined by two of his colleagues – Keiran Harris &amp; Michelle Hutchinson – to quickly discuss:<br><br>

• The risk political polarisation poses to long-termist causes<br>
• How should specialists keep journalism available as a career option?<br>
• Should we create a news aggregator that aims to make someone as well informed as possible in big-picture terms?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a cross-post of an interview Rob did with Julia Galef on her podcast <a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/" target="_blank"><b>Rationally Speaking</b></a>. Rob and Julia discuss how the career advice 80,000 Hours gives has changed over the years, and the biggest misconceptions about our views.<br><br>

The topics will be familiar to the most fervent fans of this show&nbsp;— but we think that if you’ve listened to less than about half of the episodes we've released so far, you’ll find something new to enjoy here. Julia may be familiar to you as the guest on episode 7 of the show, way back in September 2017.<br><br>

The conversation also covers topics like:<br><br>

• How many people should try to get a job in finance and donate their income?<br>
• The case for working to reduce global catastrophic risks in targeted ways, and historical precedents for this kind of work<br>
• Why reducing risk is a better way to help the future than increasing economic growth<br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>Pro-market economists love to wax rhapsodic about the capacity of markets to pull together the valuable local information spread across all of society about what people want and how to make it.<br><br>

But when it comes to politics and voting - which also aim to aggregate the preferences and knowledge found in millions of individuals - the enthusiasm for finding clever institutional designs often turns to skepticism.<br><br>

Today's guest, freewheeling economist Glen Weyl, won't have it, and is on a warpath to reform liberal democratic institutions in order to save them. Just last year he wrote <em>Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</em> with Eric Posner, but has already moved on, saying <i>"in the 6 months since the book came out I've made more intellectual progress than in the whole 10 years before that."</i><br><br>

Weyl believes we desperately need more efficient, equitable and decentralised ways to organise society, that take advantage of what each person knows, and his research agenda has already been making breakthroughs.<br><br>

Despite a history in the best economics departments in the world - Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Chicago - he is too worried for the future to sit in his office writing papers. Instead he has left the academy to try to inspire a social movement, <a href="https://80k.link/glen-weyl-radicalxchange"><b>RadicalxChange</b></a>, with a vision of social reform as expansive as his own.<br><br> 

<a href="https://80k.link/glen-weyl-radicalxchange"><b>You can sign up for their conference in Detroit in March here</b></a><br><br>

Economist Alex Tabarrok called his latest proposal, known as 'liberal radicalism', <i>"a quantum leap in public-goods mechanism-design"</i> - we explain how it works in the show. But the proposal, however good in theory, might struggle in the real world because it requires large subsidies, and compensates for people's selfishness so effectively that it might even be an overcorrection.<br><br>

An earlier mechanism - 'quadratic voting' (QV) - would allow people to express the relative strength of their preferences in the democratic process. No longer would 51 people who support a proposal, but barely care about the issue, outvote 49 incredibly passionate opponents, predictably making society worse in the process. We explain exactly how in the episode.<br><br>

Weyl points to studies showing that people are more likely to vote strongly not only about issues they *care* more about, but issues they *know* more about. He expects that allowing people to specialise and indicate when they know what they're talking about will create a democracy that does more to aggregate careful judgement, rather than just passionate ignorance.<br><br>

But these and indeed all of Weyl's ideas have faced criticism. Some say the risk of unintended consequences is too great, or that they solve the wrong problem. Others see these proposals as unproven, impractical, or just another example of an intellectual engaged in grand social planning. I raise these concerns to see how he responds.<br><br>

As big a topic as all of that is, this extended conversation also goes into the blockchain, problems with the effective altruism community and how auctions could replace private property. Don't miss it.<br><br>

Just last year he wrote <em>Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</em> with Eric Posner, but has already moved on, saying <i>"in the 6 months since the book came out I've made more intellectual progress than in the whole 10 years before that."</i><br><br>

Weyl believes we desperately need more efficient, equitable and decentralised ways to organise society, that take advantage of what each person knows, and his research agenda has already been making breakthroughs.<br><br>

Despite a history in the best economics departments in the world - Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Chicago - he is too worried for the future to sit in his office writing papers.

Economist Alex Tabarrok called his latest proposal, known as 'liberal radicalism', <i>"a quantum leap in public-goods mechanism-design"</i> - we explain how it works in the show.

An earlier mechanism - 'quadratic voting' (QV) - would allow people to express the relative strength of their preferences in the democratic process.

We explain exactly how in the episode.<br><br>

Weyl points to studies showing that people are more likely to vote strongly not only about issues they *care* more about, but issues they *know* more about. He expects that allowing people to specialise and indicate when they know what they're talking about will create a democracy that does more to aggregate careful judgement, rather than just passionate ignorance.<br><br>

But these and indeed all of Weyl's ideas have faced criticism. Some say the risk of unintended consequences is too great, or that they solve the wrong problem.

         <description><![CDATA[<b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in October 2017.</b><br><br>

What if you were in a position to give away billions of dollars to improve the world? What would you do with it? This is the problem facing Program Officers at the Open Philanthropy Project - people like Dr Nick Beckstead.<br><br>

Following a PhD in philosophy, Nick works to figure out where money can do the most good. He’s been involved in major grants in a wide range of areas, including ending factory farming through technological innovation, safeguarding the world from advances in biotechnology and artificial intelligence, and spreading rational compassion.<br><br>

* Should people who want to improve the future work for changes that will be very useful in a specific scenario, or just generally try to improve how well humanity makes decisions?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[Politics in rich countries seems to be going nuts. What's the explanation? Rising inequality? The decline of manufacturing jobs? Excessive immigration?<br><br>

Martin Gurri spent decades as a CIA analyst and in his 2014 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/1732265143"><em>The Revolt of The Public and Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium</em></a>, predicted political turbulence for an entirely different reason: new communication technologies were flipping the balance of power between the public and traditional authorities.<br><br>

In 1959 the President could control the narrative by leaning on his friends at four TV stations, who felt it was proper to present the nation's leader in a positive light, no matter their flaws. Today, it's impossible to prevent someone from broadcasting any grievance online, whether it's a contrarian insight or an insane conspiracy theory.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/martin-gurri-revolt-of-the-public/?utm_campaign=podcast__martin-gurri&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

According to Gurri, trust in society's institutions - police, journalists, scientists and more - has been undermined by constant criticism from outsiders, and exposed to a cacophony of conflicting opinions on every issue, the public takes fewer truths for granted. We are now free to see our leaders as the flawed human beings they always have been, and are not amused.<br><br>

Suspicious they are being betrayed by elites, the public can also use technology to coordinate spontaneously and express its anger. Keen to 'throw the bastards out' protesters take to the streets, united by what they don't like, but without a shared agenda or the institutional infrastructure to figure out how to fix things. Some popular movements have come to view any attempt to exercise power over others as suspect. <br><br>

If Gurri is to be believed, protest movements in Egypt, Spain, Greece and Israel in 2011 followed this script, while Brexit, Trump and the French yellow vests movement subsequently vindicated his theory.<br><br>

In this model, politics won't return to its old equilibrium any time soon. The leaders of tomorrow will need a new message and style if they hope to maintain any legitimacy in this less hierarchical world. Otherwise, we're in for decades of grinding conflict between traditional centres of authority and the general public, who doubt both their loyalty and competence. <br><br>

But how much should we believe this theory? Why do Canada and Australia remain pools of calm in the storm? Aren't some malcontents quite concrete in their demands? And are protest movements actually more common (or more nihilistic) than they were decades ago?<br><br>

In today's episode we ask these questions and add an hour-long discussion with two of Rob's colleagues - Keiran Harris and Michelle Hutchinson - to further explore the ideas in the book.<br><br>

The conversation covers:<br><br>

* How do we know that the internet is driving this rather than some other phenomenon?<br>
* How do technological changes enable social and political change?<br>
* The historical role of television<br>
* Are people also more disillusioned now with sports heroes and actors?<br>
* Which countries are finding good ways to make politics work in this new era?<br>
* What are the implications for the threat of totalitarianism?<br>
* What is this is going to do to international relations? Will it make it harder for countries to cooperate and avoid conflict?<br><br>

But how much should we believe this theory? Why do Canada and Australia remain pools of calm in the storm? Aren't some malcontents quite concrete in their demands? And are protest movements actually more common (or more nihilistic) than they were decades ago? In today's episode we ask these questions and add an hour-long discussion with two of Rob's colleagues - Keiran Harris and Michelle Hutchinson - to further explore the ideas in the book. The conversation covers: * How do we know that the internet is driving this rather than some other phenomenon? * How do technological changes enable social and political change? * The historical role of television * Are people also more disillusioned now with sports heroes and actors? * Which countries are finding good ways to make politics work in this new era? * What are the implications for the threat of totalitarianism? * What is this is going to do to international relations? Will it make it harder for countries to cooperate and avoid conflict?

Every year tens of billions of animals are raised in terrible conditions in factory farms before being killed for human consumption. Over the last two years Lewis Bollard – Project Officer for Farm Animal Welfare at the Open Philanthropy Project – has conducted extensive research into the best ways to eliminate animal suffering in farms as soon as possible. This has resulted in $30 million in grants to farm animal advocacy.<br><br>

We covered almost every approach being taken, which ones work, and how individuals can best contribute through their careers.<br><br>

We also had time to venture into a wide range of issues that are less often discussed, including:<br><br>

* Why Lewis thinks insect farming would be worse than the status quo, and whether we should look for ‘humane’ insecticides;<br>
* How young people can set themselves up to contribute to scientific research into meat alternatives;<br>
* How genetic manipulation of chickens has caused them to suffer much more than their ancestors, but could also be used to make them better off;<br>
* Why Lewis is skeptical of vegan advocacy;<br>
* Why he doubts that much can be done to tackle factory farming through legal advocacy or electoral politics;<br>

         <description><![CDATA[<b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in October 2017.</b><br><br>

Take a trip to Silicon Valley in the 70s and 80s, when going to space sounded like a good way to get around environmental limits, people started cryogenically freezing themselves, and nanotechnology looked like it might revolutionise industry – or turn us all into grey goo.<br><br>

In this episode of the 80,000 Hours Podcast, Christine Peterson takes us back to her youth in the Bay Area, the ideas she encountered there, and what the dreamers she met did as they grew up.<br><br>

Today Christine helps runs the Foresight Institute, which fills a gap left by for-profit technology companies – predicting how new revolutionary technologies could go wrong, and ensuring we steer clear of the downsides.<br><br>

We also explore:<br><br>

* Whether the poor security of computer systems poses a catastrophic risk for the world. Could all our essential services be taken down at once? And if so, what can be done about it?<br>
* Can technology ‘move fast and break things’ without eventually breaking the world? Would it be better for technology to advance more quickly, or more slowly?<br>
* Will AIs designed for wide-scale automated hacking make computers more or less secure?<br>
* Would it be good to radically extend human lifespan? Is it sensible to cryogenically freeze yourself in the hope of being resurrected in the future?<br>
* Could atomically precise manufacturing (nanotechnology) really work? Why was it initially so controversial and why did people stop worrying about it?<br>
* Should people who try to do good in their careers work long hours and take low salaries? Or should they take care of themselves first of all?<br>
* How she thinks the the effective altruism community resembles the scene she was involved with when she was wrong, and where it might be going wrong.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[If an asteroid impact or nuclear winter blocked the sun for years, our inability to grow food would result in billions dying of starvation, right? According to Dr David Denkenberger, co-author of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What">Feeding Everyone No Matter What</a></em>: no. If he's to be believed, nobody need starve at all.<br><br>

Even without the sun, David sees the Earth as a bountiful food source. Mushrooms farmed on decaying wood. Bacteria fed with natural gas. Fish and mussels supported by sudden upwelling of ocean nutrients - and more.<br><br>

Dr Denkenberger is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and he's out to spread the word that while a nuclear winter might be horrible, experts have been mistaken to assume that mass starvation is an inevitability. In fact, the only thing that would prevent us from feeding the world is insufficient preparation.<br><br>

Not content to just write a book pointing this out, David has gone on to found a growing non-profit - the <em><a href="http://allfed.info/">Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters (ALLFED)</a></em> - to prepare the world to feed everyone come what may. He expects that today 10% of people would find enough food to survive a massive disaster. In principle, if we did everything right, nobody need go hungry. But being more realistic about how much we're likely to invest, David thinks a plan to inform people ahead of time could save 30%, and a decent research and development scheme 80%.<br><br>

∙ A potential donor <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SYeJnv9vYzq9oQMbQ/2017-donor-lottery-report"><b>evaluates ALLFED</b></a><br><br>

According to David's <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-016-0097-2">published cost-benefit analyses</a>, work on this problem may be able to save lives, in expectation, for under $100 each, making it an incredible investment. <br><br>

These preparations could also help make humanity more resilient to global catastrophic risks, by forestalling an ‘everyone for themselves' mentality, which then causes trade and civilization to unravel.<br><br>

But some worry that David's cost-effectiveness estimates are exaggerations, so I challenge him on the practicality of his approach, and how much his non-profit's work would actually matter in a post-apocalyptic world. In our extensive conversation, we cover:<br><br>

* How could the sun end up getting blocked, or agriculture otherwise be decimated?<br>
* What are all the ways we could we eat nonetheless? What kind of life would this be?<br>
* Can these methods be scaled up fast?<br>
* What is his organisation, ALLFED, actually working on?<br>
* How does he estimate the cost-effectiveness of this work, and what are the biggest weaknesses of the approach?<br>
* How would more food affect the post-apocalyptic world? Won't people figure it out at that point anyway?<br>

According to Dr David Denkenberger, co-author of Feeding Everyone No Matter What: no. If he's to be believed, nobody need starve at all. Even without the sun, David sees the Earth as a bountiful food source. Mushrooms farmed on decaying wood. Bacteria fed with natural gas. Fish and mussels supported by sudden upwelling of ocean nutrients - and more. Dr Denkenberger is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and he's out to spread the word that while a nuclear winter might be horrible, experts have been mistaken to assume that mass starvation is an inevitability. In fact, the only thing that would prevent us from feeding the world is insufficient preparation. ∙ Links to learn more, summary and full transcript Not content to just write a book pointing this out, David has gone on to found a growing non-profit - the Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters (ALLFED) - to prepare the world to feed everyone come what may. He expects that today 10% of people would find enough food to survive a massive disaster. In principle, if we did everything right, nobody need go hungry. But being more realistic about how much we're likely to invest, David thinks a plan to inform people ahead of time could save 30%, and a decent research and development scheme 80%. ∙ 80,000 Hours' updated article on How to find the best charity to give to ∙ A potential donor evaluates ALLFED According to David's published cost-benefit analyses, work on this problem may be able to save lives, in expectation, for under $100 each, making it an incredible investment. These preparations could also help make humanity more resilient to global catastrophic risks, by forestalling an ‘everyone for themselves' mentality, which then causes trade and civilization to unravel. But some worry that David's cost-effectiveness estimates are exaggerations, so I challenge him on the practicality of his approach, and how much his non-profit's work would actually matter in a post-apocalyptic world. In our extensive conversation, we cover: * How could the sun end up getting blocked, or agriculture otherwise be decimated? * What are all the ways we could we eat nonetheless? What kind of life would this be? * Can these methods be scaled up fast? * What is his organisation, ALLFED, actually working on? * How does he estimate the cost-effectiveness of this work, and what are the biggest weaknesses of the approach? * How would more food affect the post-apocalyptic world? Won't people figure it out at that point anyway? * Why not just leave guidebooks with this information in every city? * Would these preparations make nuclear war more likely? * What kind of people is ALLFED trying to hire? * What would ALLFED do with more money? * How he ended up doing this work. And his other engineering proposals for improving the world, including ideas to prevent a supervolcano explosion.

         <description><![CDATA[If I told you it's possible to deliver an extra year of ideal primary-level education for under $1, would you believe me? Hopefully not - the claim is absurd on its face.<br><br>

But it may be true nonetheless. The very best education interventions are phenomenally cost-effective, and they're not the kinds of things you'd expect, says Dr Rachel Glennerster.<br><br>

She's Chief Economist at the UK's foreign aid agency DFID, and used to run J-PAL, the world-famous anti-poverty research centre based in MIT's Economics Department, where she studied the impact of a wide range of approaches to improving education, health, and governing institutions. According to Dr Glennerster:<br><br>

<em>"...when we looked at the cost effectiveness of education programs, there were a ton of zeros, and there were a ton of zeros on the things that we spend most of our money on. So more teachers, more books, more inputs, like smaller class sizes - at least in the developing world - seem to have no impact, and that's where most government money gets spent."<br><br>

"But measurements for the top ones - the most cost effective programs - say they deliver 460 LAYS per £100 spent ($US130). LAYS are Learning-Adjusted Years of Schooling. Each one is the equivalent of the best possible year of education you can have - Singapore-level."</em><br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/rachel-glennerster"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

<em>"...the two programs that come out as spectacularly effective... well, the first is just rearranging kids in a class."<br><br>

"You have to test the kids, so that you can put the kids who are performing at grade two level in the grade two class, and the kids who are performing at grade four level in the grade four class, even if they're different ages - and they learn so much better. So that's why it's so phenomenally cost effective because, it really doesn't cost anything."<br><br>

"The other one is providing information. So sending information over the phone [for example about how much more people earn if they do well in school and graduate]. So these really small nudges. Now none of those nudges will individually transform any kid's life, but they are so cheap that you get these fantastic returns on investment - and we do very little of that kind of thing."</em><br><br>

In this episode, Dr Glennerster shares her decades of accumulated wisdom on which anti-poverty programs are overrated, which are neglected opportunities, and how we can know the difference, across a range of fields including health, empowering women and macroeconomic policy.<br><br>

Regular listeners will be wondering - have we forgotten all about the lessons from <a href="https://80k.link/rachel-to-eva-episode">episode 30 of the show with Dr Eva Vivalt</a>? She threw several buckets of cold water on the hope that we could accurately measure the effectiveness of social programs at all.<br><br>

According to Vivalt, her dataset of hundreds of randomised controlled trials indicates that social science findings don’t generalize well at all. The results of a trial at a school in Namibia tell us remarkably little about how a similar program will perform if delivered at another school in Namibia - let alone if it's attempted in India instead.<br><br>

Rachel offers a different and more optimistic interpretation of Eva's findings. To learn more and figure out who you sympathise with more, you'll just have to listen to the episode.<br><br>

Regardless, Vivalt and Glennerster agree that we should continue to run these kinds of studies, and today’s episode delves into the latest ideas in global health and development.<br><br>

Of all the people whose well-being we should care about, only a small fraction are alive today. The rest are members of future generations who are yet to exist. Whether they’ll be born into a world that is flourishing or disintegrating – and indeed, whether they will ever be born at all – is in large part up to us. As such, the welfare of future generations should be our number one moral concern.<br><br>

This conclusion holds true regardless of whether your moral framework is based on common sense, consequences, rules of ethical conduct, cooperating with others, virtuousness, keeping options open – or just a sense of wonder about the universe we find ourselves in.<br><br>

That’s the view of Dr Toby Ord, a philosophy Fellow at the University of Oxford and co-founder of the effective altruism community. In this episode Dr Ord makes the case that aiming for a positive long-term future is likely the best way to improve the world.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<b>Rebroadcast: this episode was originally released in November 2017.</b><br><br>

Prof Philip Tetlock is a social science legend. Over forty years he has researched whose predictions we can trust, whose we can’t and why - and developed methods that allow all of us to be better at predicting the future.<br><br>

After the Iraq WMDs fiasco, the US intelligence services hired him to figure out how to ensure they’d never screw up that badly again. The result of that work – <em>Superforecasting</em> – was a media sensation in 2015.<br><br>

It described Tetlock’s Good Judgement Project, which found forecasting methods so accurate they beat everyone else in open competition, including thousands of people in the intelligence services with access to classified information.<br><br>

Today he’s working to develop the best forecasting process ever, by combining top human and machine intelligence in the <a href="https://www.hybridforecasting.com/">Hybrid Forecasting Competition</a>, which you can sign up and participate in.<br><br>

We start by describing his key findings, and then push to the edge of what is known about how to foresee the unforeseeable:<br><br>

* Should people who want to be right just adopt the views of experts rather than apply their own judgement?<br>
* Why are Berkeley undergrads worse forecasters than dart-throwing chimps?<br>
* Should I keep my political views secret, so it will be easier to change them later?<br>
* How can listeners contribute to his latest cutting-edge research?<br>
* What do we know about our accuracy at predicting low-probability high-impact disasters?<br>
* Does his research provide an intellectual basis for populist political movements?<br>
* Was the Iraq War caused by bad politics, or bad intelligence methods?<br>
* What can we learn about forecasting from the 2016 election?<br>
* Can experience help people avoid overconfidence and underconfidence?<br>
* When does an AI easily beat human judgement?<br>
* Could more accurate forecasting methods make the world more dangerous?<br>
* How much does demographic diversity line up with cognitive diversity?<br>
* What are the odds we’ll go to war with China?<br>
* Should we let prediction tournaments run most of the government?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Please let us know if we've helped you: <a href="https://80k.link/survey-christian"><b>Fill out our annual impact survey</b></a><br><br>

Ever felt that you were so busy you spent all your time paralysed trying to figure out where to start, and couldn't get much done? Computer scientists have a term for this - <em>thrashing</em> - and it's a common reason our computers freeze up. The solution, for people as well as laptops, is to 'work dumber': pick something at random and finish it, without wasting time thinking about the bigger picture.<br><br>

Bestselling author Brian Christian studied computer science, and in the book <b>Algorithms to Live By</b> he's out to find the lessons it can offer for a better life. He investigates into when to quit your job, when to marry, the best way to sell your house, how long to spend on a difficult decision, and how much randomness to inject into your life. In each case computer science gives us a theoretically optimal solution, and in this episode we think hard about whether its models match our reality. <br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/brian-podcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

One genre of problems Brian explores in his book are 'optimal stopping problems', the canonical example of which is ‘the secretary problem’. Imagine you're hiring a secretary, you receive *n* applicants, they show up in a random order, and you interview them one after another. You either have to hire that person on the spot and dismiss everybody else, or send them away and lose the option to hire them in future.<br><br>

It turns out most of life can be viewed this way - a series of unique opportunities you pass by that will never be available in exactly the same way again.<br><br>

So how do you attempt to hire the very best candidate in the pool? There's a risk that you stop before finding the best, and a risk that you set your standards too high and let the best candidate pass you by.<br><br>

Mathematicians of the mid-twentieth century produced an elegant optimal approach: spend exactly one over *e*, or approximately 37% of your search, just establishing a baseline without hiring anyone, no matter how promising they seem. Then immediately hire the next person who's better than anyone you've seen so far.<br><br>

It turns out that your odds of success in this scenario are also 37%. And the optimal strategy and the odds of success are identical regardless of the size of the pool. So as *n* goes to infinity you still want to follow this 37% rule, and you still have a 37% chance of success. Even if you interview a million people.<br><br>

But if you have the option to go back, say by apologising to the first applicant and begging them to come work with you, and you have a 50% chance of your apology being accepted, then the optimal explore percentage rises all the way to 61%. <br><br>

Today’s episode focuses on Brian’s book-length exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can and can't be applied to our everyday lives. We cover:<br><br>

* Computational kindness, and the best way to schedule meetings<br>
* How can we characterize a computational model of what people are actually doing, and is there a rigorous way to analyse just how good their instincts actually are?<br>
* What’s it like being a human confederate in the Turing test competition?<br>
* Is trying to detect fake social media accounts a losing battle?<br>
* The canonical explore/exploit problem in computer science:  the multi-armed bandit<br>
* What’s the optimal way to buy or sell a house?<br>
* Why is information economics so important?<br>
* What kind of decisions should people randomize more in life?<br>
* How much time should we spend on prioritisation?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[After dropping out of a machine learning PhD at Stanford, Daniel Ziegler needed to decide what to do next. He’d always enjoyed building stuff and wanted to shape the development of AI, so he thought a research engineering position at an org dedicated to aligning AI with human interests could be his best option.<br><br>

He decided to apply to OpenAI, and spent about 6 weeks preparing for the interview before landing the job. His PhD, by contrast, might have taken 6 years. Daniel thinks this highly accelerated career path may be possible for many others.<br><br>

On today’s episode Daniel is joined by Catherine Olsson, who has also worked at OpenAI, and left her computational neuroscience PhD to become a research engineer at Google Brain. She and Daniel share this piece of advice for those curious about this career path: just dive in. If you're trying to get good at something, just start doing that thing, and figure out that way what's necessary to be able to do it well.<br><br>

Catherine has even <a href="https://80k.link/ml-engineering-career-transition-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">created a simple step-by-step guide</a> for 80,000 Hours, to make it as easy as possible for others to copy her and Daniel's success.<br><br>

<em>Please let us know how we've helped you: fill out <a href="https://80k.link/survey-c-and-z"><b>our 2018 annual impact survey</b></a> so that 80,000 Hours can continue to operate and grow.</em><br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/olsson-and-ziegler-ml-engineering-and-safety" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Blog post with links to learn more, a summary & full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

Daniel thinks the key for him was nailing the job interview.<br><br>

OpenAI needed him to be able to demonstrate the ability to do the kind of stuff he'd be working on day-to-day. So his approach was to take a list of 50 key deep reinforcement learning papers, read one or two a day, and pick a handful to actually reproduce. He spent a bunch of time coding in Python and TensorFlow, sometimes 12 hours a day, trying to debug and tune things until they were actually working.<br><br>

Daniel emphasizes that the most important thing was to practice *exactly* those things that he knew he needed to be able to do. His dedicated preparation also led to an offer from the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and so he had the opportunity to decide between two organisations focused on the global problem that most concerns him.<br><br> 

Daniel’s path might seem unusual, but both he and Catherine expect it can be replicated by others. If they're right, it could greatly increase our ability to get new people into important ML roles in which they can make a difference, as quickly as possible.<br><br>

Catherine says that her move from OpenAI to an ML research team at Google now allows her to bring a different set of skills to the table. Technical AI safety is a multifaceted area of research, and the many sub-questions in areas such as reward learning, robustness, and interpretability all need to be answered to maximize the probability that AI development goes well for humanity.<br><br> 

Today’s episode combines the expertise of two pioneers and is a key resource for anyone wanting to follow in their footsteps. We cover:<br><br>

* What are OpenAI and Google Brain doing?<br> 
* Why work on AI?<br>
* Do you learn more on the job, or while doing a PhD?<br>
* Controversial issues within ML<br>
* Is replicating papers a good way of determining suitability?<br>
* What % of software developers could make similar transitions?<br>
* How in-demand are research engineers?<br>
* The development of Dota 2 bots<br>
* Do research scientists have more influence on the vision of an org?<br>
* Has learning more made you more or less worried about the future?<br><br>

Daniel thinks the key for him was nailing the job interview.<br><br>

OpenAI needed him to be able to demonstrate the ability to do the kind of stuff he'd be working on day-to-day. So his approach was to take a list of 50 key deep reinforcement learning papers, read one or two a day, and pick a handful to actually reproduce. He spent a bunch of time coding in Python and TensorFlow, sometimes 12 hours a day, trying to debug and tune things until they were actually working.<br><br>

Daniel emphasizes that the most important thing was to practice *exactly* those things that he knew he needed to be able to do. His dedicated preparation also led to an offer from the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and so he had the opportunity to decide between two organisations focused on the global problem that most concerns him.<br><br> 

Daniel’s path might seem unusual, but both he and Catherine expect it can be replicated by others. If they're right, it could greatly increase our ability to get new people into important ML roles in which they can make a difference, as quickly as possible.<br><br>

Catherine says that her move from OpenAI to an ML research team at Google now allows her to bring a different set of skills to the table. Technical AI safety is a multifaceted area of research, and the many sub-questions in areas such as reward learning, robustness, and interpretability all need to be answered to maximize the probability that AI development goes well for humanity.<br><br> 

Today’s episode combines the expertise of two pioneers and is a key resource for anyone wanting to follow in their footsteps. We cover:<br><br>

* What are OpenAI and Google Brain doing?<br> 
* Why work on AI?<br>
* Do you learn more on the job, or while doing a PhD?<br>
* Controversial issues within ML<br>
* Is replicating papers a good way of determining suitability?<br>
* What % of software developers could make similar transitions?<br>
* How in-demand are research engineers?<br>
* The development of Dota 2 bots<br>
* Do research scientists have more influence on the vision of an org?<br>
* Has learning more made you more or less worried about the future?<br><br>

He’d always enjoyed building stuff and wanted to shape the development of AI, so he thought a research engineering position at an org dedicated to aligning AI with human interests could be his best option. He decided to apply to OpenAI, and spent about 6 weeks preparing for the interview before landing the job. His PhD, by contrast, might have taken 6 years. Daniel thinks this highly accelerated career path may be possible for many others. On today’s episode Daniel is joined by Catherine Olsson, who has also worked at OpenAI, and left her computational neuroscience PhD to become a research engineer at Google Brain. She and Daniel share this piece of advice for those curious about this career path: just dive in. If you're trying to get good at something, just start doing that thing, and figure out that way what's necessary to be able to do it well. Catherine has even created a simple step-by-step guide for 80,000 Hours, to make it as easy as possible for others to copy her and Daniel's success.

         <description><![CDATA[The barista gives you your coffee and change, and you walk away from the busy line. But you suddenly realise she gave you $1 less than she should have. Do you brush your way past the people now waiting, or just accept this as a dollar you’re never getting back? According to philosophy Professor Hilary Greaves - Director of Oxford University's <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org">Global Priorities Institute</a>, which <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/opportunities/">is hiring</a> - this simple decision will completely change the long-term future by altering the identities of almost all future generations.<br><br>

How? Because by rushing back to the counter, you slightly change the timing of everything else people in line do during that day - including changing the timing of the interactions they have with everyone else. Eventually these causal links will reach someone who was going to conceive a child.<br><br>

By causing a child to be conceived a few fractions of a second earlier or later, you change the sperm that fertilizes their egg, resulting in a totally different person. So asking for that $1 has now made the difference between all the things that this actual child will do in their life, and all the things that the merely possible child - who didn't exist because of what you did - would have done if you decided not to worry about it.<br><br>

As that child's actions ripple out to everyone else who conceives down the generations, ultimately the entire human population will become different, all for the sake of your dollar. Will your choice cause a future Hitler to be born, or not to be born? Probably both!<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hilary-greaves-global-priorities-institute/?utm_campaign=podcast__hilary-greaves&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

Some find this concerning. The actual long term effects of your decisions are so unpredictable, it looks like you’re totally clueless about what's going to lead to the best outcomes. It might lead to decision paralysis - you won’t be able to take any action at all.<br><br>

Prof Greaves doesn’t share this concern for most real life decisions. If there’s no reasonable way to assign probabilities to far-future outcomes, then the possibility that you might make things better in completely unpredictable ways is more or less canceled out by equally likely opposite possibility.<br><br>

But, if instead we’re talking about a decision that involves highly-structured, systematic reasons for thinking there might be a general tendency of your action to make things better or worse -- for example if we increase economic growth -- Prof Greaves says that we don’t get to just ignore the unforeseeable effects. <br><br>

When there are complex arguments on both sides, it's unclear what probabilities you should assign to this or that claim. Yet, given its importance, whether you should take the action in question actually does depend on figuring out these numbers. So, what do we do?<br><br>

Today’s episode blends philosophy with an exploration of the mission and research agenda of the Global Priorities Institute: to develop the effective altruism movement within academia. We cover:<br><br>

* How controversial is the multiverse interpretation of quantum physics?<br />
* Given moral uncertainty, how should population ethics affect our real life decisions?<br />
* How should we think about archetypal decision theory problems?<br />
* What are the consequences of cluelessness for those who based their donation advice on GiveWell style recommendations?<br />

         <description><![CDATA[I've probably spent more time reading Tyler Cowen - Professor of Economics at George Mason University - than any other author. Indeed it's his incredibly popular blog <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">Marginal Revolution</a> that prompted me to study economics in the first place. Having spent thousands of hours absorbing Tyler's work, it was a pleasure to be able to question him about his latest book and personal manifesto: <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#stubborn-attachments"><em>Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals</em></a>.<br><br>

Tyler makes the case that, despite what you may have heard, we *can* make rational judgments about what is best for society as a whole. He argues:<br><br>

1. Our top moral priority should be preserving and improving humanity's long-term future<br>
2. The way to do that is to maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth<br>
3. We should respect human rights and follow general principles while doing so.<br><br>

We discuss why Tyler believes all these things, and I push back where I disagree. In particular: is higher economic growth actually an effective way to safeguard humanity's future, or should our focus really be elsewhere?<br><br>

In the process we touch on many of moral philosophy's most pressing questions: Should we discount the future? How should we aggregate welfare across people? Should we follow rules or evaluate every situation individually? How should we deal with the massive uncertainty about the effects of our actions? And should we trust common sense morality or follow structured theories?<br><br>

After covering the book, the conversation ranges far and wide. Will we leave the galaxy, and is it a tragedy if we don't? Is a multi-polar world less stable? Will humanity ever help wild animals? Why do we both agree that Kant and Rawls are overrated?<br><br>

Today's interview is released on both the 80,000 Hours Podcast and Tyler's own show: <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler">Conversation with Tyler</a>.<br><br>

Tyler may have had more influence on me than any other writer but this conversation is richer for our remaining disagreements. If the above isn't enough to tempt you to listen, we also look at:<br><br>

* Why couldn’t future technology make human life a hundred or a thousand times better than it is for people today?<br>
* Why focus on increasing the rate of economic growth rather than making sure that it doesn’t go to zero?<br>
* Why shouldn’t we dedicate substantial time to the successful introduction of genetic engineering?<br>
* Why should we completely abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm?<br>
* Why is Tyler so pessimistic about space? Is it likely that humans will go extinct before we manage to escape the galaxy?<br>
* Is improving coordination and international cooperation a major priority?<br>
* Why does Tyler think institutions are keeping up with technology?<br>
* Given that our actions seem to have very large and morally significant effects in the long run, are our moral obligations very onerous?<br>
* Can art be intrinsically valuable?<br>
* What does Tyler think Derek Parfit was most wrong about, and what was he was most right about that’s unappreciated today?<br><br>

And should we trust common sense morality or follow structured theories? Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. After covering the book, the conversation ranges far and wide. Will we leave the galaxy, and is it a tragedy if we don't? Is a multi-polar world less stable? Will humanity ever help wild animals? Why do we both agree that Kant and Rawls are overrated? Today's interview is released on both the 80,000 Hours Podcast and Tyler's own show: Conversation with Tyler. Tyler may have had more influence on me than any other writer but this conversation is richer for our remaining disagreements. If the above isn't enough to tempt you to listen, we also look at: * Why couldn’t future technology make human life a hundred or a thousand times better than it is for people today? * Why focus on increasing the rate of economic growth rather than making sure that it doesn’t go to zero? * Why shouldn’t we dedicate substantial time to the successful introduction of genetic engineering? * Why should we completely abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm? * Why is Tyler so pessimistic about space? Is it likely that humans will go extinct before we manage to escape the galaxy? * Is improving coordination and international cooperation a major priority? * Why does Tyler think institutions are keeping up with technology? * Given that our actions seem to have very large and morally significant effects in the long run, are our moral obligations very onerous? * Can art be intrinsically valuable? * What does Tyler think Derek Parfit was most wrong about, and what was he was most right about that’s unappreciated today?

         <description><![CDATA[Paul Christiano is one of the smartest people I know. After our first session produced such great material, we decided to do a second recording, resulting in our longest interview so far. While challenging at times I can strongly recommend listening - Paul works on AI himself and has a very unusually thought through view of how it will change the world. This is now the top resource I'm going to refer people to if they're interested in positively shaping the development of AI, and want to understand the problem better. Even though I'm familiar with Paul's writing I felt I was learning a great deal and am now in a better position to make a difference to the world.<br><br>

A few of the topics we cover are:<br><br>

* Why Paul expects AI to transform the world gradually rather than explosively and what that would look like<br>
* Several concrete methods OpenAI is trying to develop to ensure AI systems do what we want even if they become more competent than us<br>
* Why AI systems will probably be granted legal and property rights<br>
* How an advanced AI that doesn't share human goals could still have moral value<br>
* Why machine learning might take over science research from humans before it can do most other tasks<br>
* Which decade we should expect human labour to become obsolete, and how this should affect your savings plan.<br><br>

Important new article: <a href="https://80k.link/high-impact-careers-paul"><b>These are the world’s highest impact career paths according to our research</b></a><br><br>

Here's a situation we all regularly confront: you want to answer a difficult question, but aren't quite smart or informed enough to figure it out for yourself. The good news is you have access to experts who *are* smart enough to figure it out. The bad news is that they disagree.<br><br>

If given plenty of time - and enough arguments, counterarguments and counter-counter-arguments between all the experts - should you eventually be able to figure out which is correct? What if one expert were deliberately trying to mislead you? And should the expert with the correct view just tell the whole truth, or will competition force them to throw in persuasive lies in order to have a chance of winning you over?<br><br>

In other words: does 'debate', in principle, lead to truth?<br><br>

According to Paul Christiano - researcher at the machine learning research lab OpenAI and legendary thinker in the effective altruism and rationality communities - this question is of more than mere philosophical interest. That's because 'debate' is a promising method of keeping artificial intelligence aligned with human goals, even if it becomes much more intelligent and sophisticated than we are.<br><br>

It's a method OpenAI is <a href="https://blog.openai.com/debate/">actively trying to develop</a>, because in the long-term it wants to train AI systems to make decisions that are too complex for any human to grasp, but without the risks that arise from a complete loss of human oversight.<br><br> 

If AI-1 is free to choose any line of argument in order to attack the ideas of AI-2, and AI-2 always seems to successfully defend them, it suggests that every possible line of argument would have been unsuccessful.<br><br>

But does that mean that the ideas of AI-2 were actually right? It would be nice if the optimal strategy in debate were to be completely honest, provide good arguments, and respond to counterarguments in a valid way. But we don't know that's the case.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[In Stanley Kubrick’s iconic film Dr. Strangelove, the American president is informed that the Soviet Union has created a secret deterrence system which will automatically wipe out humanity upon detection of a single nuclear explosion in Russia. With US bombs heading towards the USSR and unable to be recalled, Dr Strangelove points out that “the whole point of this Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret – why didn’t you tell the world, eh?” The Soviet ambassador replies that it was to be announced at the Party Congress the following Monday: “The Premier loves surprises”. <br><br>

Daniel Ellsberg - leaker of the Pentagon Papers which helped end the Vietnam War and Nixon presidency - claims in his new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Machine-Confessions-Nuclear-Planner/dp/1608196704/">The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner</a> that Dr. Strangelove might as well be a documentary. After attending the film in Washington DC in 1964, he and a colleague wondered how so many details of their nuclear planning had leaked.<br><br>

The USSR did in fact develop a doomsday machine, Dead Hand, which probably remains active today. <br><br>

If the system can’t contact military leaders, it checks for signs of a nuclear strike, and if it detects them, automatically launches all remaining Soviet weapons at targets across the northern hemisphere.<br><br>

As in the film, the Soviet Union long kept Dead Hand completely secret, eliminating any strategic benefit, and rendering it a pointless menace to humanity.<br><br>

You might think the United States would have a more sensible nuclear launch policy. You’d be wrong.<br><br>

As Ellsberg explains, based on first-hand experience as a nuclear war planner in the 50s, that the notion that only the president is able to authorize the use of US nuclear weapons is a carefully cultivated myth.<br><br>

The authority to launch nuclear weapons is delegated alarmingly far down the chain of command – significantly raising the chance that a lone wolf or communication breakdown could trigger a nuclear catastrophe.<br><br>

The whole justification for this is to defend against a ‘decapitating attack’, where a first strike on Washington disables the ability of the US hierarchy to retaliate. In a moment of crisis, the Russians might view this as their best hope of survival.<br><br>

Ostensibly, this delegation removes Russia’s temptation to attempt a decapitating attack – the US can retaliate even if its leadership is destroyed. This strategy only works, though, if the tell the enemy you’ve done it.<br><br>

Instead, since the 50s this delegation has been one of the United States most closely guarded secrets, eliminating its strategic benefit, and rendering it another pointless menace to humanity.<br><br>
Strategically, the setup is stupid. Ethically, it is monstrous.<br><br>
So – how was such a system built? Why does it remain to this day? And how might we shrink our nuclear arsenals to the point they don’t risk the destruction of civilization?<br><br>

Daniel explores these questions eloquently and urgently in his book. Today we cover:<br><br>

* Why full disarmament today would be a mistake and the optimal number of nuclear weapons to hold<br>
* How well are secrets kept in the government?<br>
* What was the risk of the first atomic bomb test?<br>
* The effect of Trump on nuclear security<br>
* Do we have a reliable estimate of the magnitude of a ‘nuclear winter’?<br>
* Why Gorbachev allowed Russia’s covert biological warfare program to continue<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Consider two familiar moments at a family reunion.<br><br>

Our host, Uncle Bill, takes pride in his barbecuing skills. But his niece Becky says that she now refuses to eat meat. A groan goes round the table; the family mostly think of this as an annoying picky preference. But if seriously considered as a moral position, as they might if instead Becky were avoiding meat on religious grounds, it would usually receive a very different reaction.<br><br>

An hour later Bill expresses a strong objection to abortion. Again, a groan goes round the table; the family mostly think that he has no business in trying to foist his regressive preference on anyone. But if considered not as a matter of personal taste, but rather as a moral position - that Bill genuinely believes he’s opposing mass-murder - his comment might start a serious conversation.<br><br>

Amanda Askell, who recently completed a PhD in philosophy at NYU focused on the ethics of infinity, thinks that we often betray a complete lack of moral empathy. All sides of the political spectrum struggle to get inside the mind of people we disagree with and see issues from their point of view.<br><br>

This often happens because of confusion between preferences and moral positions.<br><br>

Assuming good faith on the part of the person you disagree with, and actually engaging with the beliefs they claim to hold, is perhaps the best remedy for our inability to make progress on controversial issues. <br><br>

One potential path for progress surrounds contraception; a lot of people who are anti-abortion are also anti-contraception. But they’ll usually think that abortion is much worse than contraception, so why can’t we compromise and agree to have much more contraception available?<br><br>

<a href="http://www.rationalreflection.net/vegetarianism-abortion-and-moral-empathy/">According to Amanda</a>, a charitable explanation for this is that people who are anti-abortion and anti-contraception engage in moral reasoning and advocacy based on what, in their minds, is the best of all possible worlds: one where people neither use contraception nor get abortions.<br><br>

So instead of arguing about abortion and contraception, we could discuss the underlying principle that one should advocate for the best possible world, rather than the best probable world.<br><br>

Successfully break down such ethical beliefs, absent political toxicity, and it might be possible to actually converge on a key point of agreement.<br><br>

Today’s episode blends such everyday topics with in-depth philosophy, including:<br><br>

* What is 'moral cluelessness' and how can we work around it?<br>
* Amanda's biggest criticisms of social justice activists, and of critics of social justice activists<br>
* Is there an ethical difference between prison and corporal punishment?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[With 698 inmates per 100,000 citizens, the U.S. is by far the leader among large wealthy nations in incarceration. But what effect does imprisonment actually have on crime?<br /><br />

According to David Roodman, Senior Advisor to the Open Philanthropy Project, the marginal effect is zero.<br /><br />

* <a href="https://80k.link/audiobook"><b>ROB'S AUDIOBOOK RECOMMENDATIONS</b></a><br><br>

This stunning rebuke to the American criminal justice system comes from the man Holden Karnofsky’s called "the gold standard for in-depth quantitative research", whose other investigations include the risk of geomagnetic storms, whether deworming improves health and test scores, and the development impacts of microfinance.<br /><br />

The effects of crime can be split into three categories; before, during, and after.<br /><br />

Does having tougher sentences deter people from committing crime?<br /><br /> 

After reviewing studies on gun laws and ‘three strikes’ in California, David concluded that the effect of deterrence is zero.<br /><br />

Does imprisoning more people reduce crime by incapacitating potential offenders?<br /><br /> 

Here he says yes, noting that crimes like motor vehicle theft have gone up in a way that seems pretty clearly connected with recent Californian criminal justice reforms (though the effect on violent crime is far lower).<br /><br />

Finally, do the after-effects of prison make you more or less likely to commit future crimes?<br /><br /> 

This one is more complicated.<br /><br />

Concerned that he was biased towards a comfortable position against incarceration, David did a cost-benefit analysis using both his favored reading of the evidence and the devil's advocate view; that there is deterrence and that the after-effects are beneficial.<br /><br />

For the devil’s advocate position David used the highest assessment of  the harm caused by crime, which suggests a year of prison prevents about $92,000 in crime. But weighed against a lost year of liberty, valued at $50,000, plus the cost of operating prisons, the numbers came out exactly the same.<br /><br /> 

So even using the least-favorable cost-benefit valuation of the least favorable reading of the evidence -- it just breaks even.<br /><br />

The argument for incarceration melts further when you consider the significant crime that occurs within prisons, de-emphasised because of a lack of data and a perceived lack of compassion for inmates.<br /><br />

In today’s episode we discuss how to conduct such impactful research, and how to proceed having reached strong conclusions.<br /><br />

We also cover:<br /><br />

* How do you become a world class researcher? What kinds of character traits are important?<br />
* Are academics aware of following perverse incentives?<br />
* What’s involved in data replication? How often do papers replicate?<br />
* The politics of large orgs vs. small orgs<br />
* Geomagnetic storms as a potential cause area<br />
* How much does David rely on interviews with experts?<br />
* The effects of deworming on child health and test scores<br />
* Should we have more ‘data vigilantes’?<br />
* What are David’s critiques of effective altruism?<br />
* What are the pros and cons of starting your career in the think tank world?<br /><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Experts believe that artificial intelligence will be better than humans at driving trucks by 2027, working in retail by 2031, writing bestselling books by 2049, and working as surgeons by 2053. But how seriously should we take these predictions?<br /><br />

Katja Grace, lead author of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf?_sp=c803ec8d-9f8f-4843-a81e-3284733403a0.1500631875031" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">‘When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?’</a>, thinks we should treat such guesses as only weak evidence. But she also says there might be much better ways to forecast transformative technology, and that anticipating such advances could be one of our most important projects.<br /><br />

<b>Note: Katja's organisation AI Impacts <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/jobs/">is currently hiring part- and full-time researchers.</a></b><br><br>

There’s often pessimism around making accurate predictions in general, and some areas of artificial intelligence might be particularly difficult to forecast.<br /><br /> 

But there are also many things we’re able to predict confidently today -- like the climate of Oxford in five years -- that we no longer give ourselves much credit for.<br /><br />

Some aspects of transformative technologies could fall into this category. And these easier predictions could give us some structure on which to base the more complicated ones.<br /><br />

One controversial debate surrounds the idea of an intelligence explosion; how likely is it that there will be a sudden jump in AI capability?<br /><br />

And one way to tackle this is to investigate a more concrete question: what’s the base rate of any technology having a big discontinuity?<br /><br />

A significant historical example was the development of nuclear weapons. Over thousands of years, the efficacy of explosives didn’t increase by much. Then within a few years, it got thousands of times better. Discovering what leads to such anomalies may allow us to better predict the possibility of a similar jump in AI capabilities.<br /><br />

In today’s interview we also discuss:<br><br>

* Why is AI impacts one of the most important projects in the world?<br /> 
* How do you structure important surveys? Why do you get such different answers when asking what seem to be very similar questions?<br />
* How does writing an academic paper differ from posting a summary online?<br />
* When will unguided machines be able to produce better and cheaper work than humans for every possible task?<br />
* What’s one of the most likely jobs to be automated soon?<br />
* Are people always just predicting the same timelines for new technologies?<br />
* How do AGI researchers different from other AI researchers in their predictions?<br />
* What are attitudes to safety research like within ML? Are there regional differences?<br />
* How much should we believe experts generally?<br />
* How does the human brain compare to our best supercomputers? How many human brains are worth all the hardware in the world?<br />
* How quickly has the processing capacity for machine learning problems been increasing?<br />
* What can we learn from the development of previous technologies in figuring out how fast transformative AI will arrive?<br />
* What should we expect from a post AI dominated economy?<br />
* How much influence can people ever have on things that will happen in 20 years? Are there any examples of people really trying to do this?<br><br>

Katja Grace, lead author of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf?_sp=c803ec8d-9f8f-4843-a81e-3284733403a0.1500631875031" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">‘When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?’</a>, thinks we should treat such guesses as only weak evidence. But she also says there might be much better ways to forecast transformative technology, and that anticipating such advances could be one of our most important projects.<br /><br />

<b>Note: Katja's organisation AI Impacts <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/jobs/">is currently hiring part- and full-time researchers.</a></b><br><br>

There’s often pessimism around making accurate predictions in general, and some areas of artificial intelligence might be particularly difficult to forecast.<br /><br /> 

But there are also many things we’re able to predict confidently today -- like the climate of Oxford in five years -- that we no longer give ourselves much credit for.<br /><br />

Some aspects of transformative technologies could fall into this category. And these easier predictions could give us some structure on which to base the more complicated ones.<br /><br />

One controversial debate surrounds the idea of an intelligence explosion; how likely is it that there will be a sudden jump in AI capability?<br /><br />

And one way to tackle this is to investigate a more concrete question: what’s the base rate of any technology having a big discontinuity?<br /><br />

A significant historical example was the development of nuclear weapons. Over thousands of years, the efficacy of explosives didn’t increase by much. Then within a few years, it got thousands of times better. Discovering what leads to such anomalies may allow us to better predict the possibility of a similar jump in AI capabilities.<br /><br />

In today’s interview we also discuss:<br><br>

* Why is AI impacts one of the most important projects in the world?<br /> 
* How do you structure important surveys? Why do you get such different answers when asking what seem to be very similar questions?<br />
* How does writing an academic paper differ from posting a summary online?<br />
* When will unguided machines be able to produce better and cheaper work than humans for every possible task?<br />
* What’s one of the most likely jobs to be automated soon?<br />
* Are people always just predicting the same timelines for new technologies?<br />
* How do AGI researchers different from other AI researchers in their predictions?<br />
* What are attitudes to safety research like within ML? Are there regional differences?<br />
* How much should we believe experts generally?<br />
* How does the human brain compare to our best supercomputers? How many human brains are worth all the hardware in the world?<br />
* How quickly has the processing capacity for machine learning problems been increasing?<br />
* What can we learn from the development of previous technologies in figuring out how fast transformative AI will arrive?<br />
* What should we expect from a post AI dominated economy?<br />
* How much influence can people ever have on things that will happen in 20 years? Are there any examples of people really trying to do this?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Will Trump be re-elected? Will North Korea give up their nuclear weapons? Will your friend turn up to dinner?<br /><br />

Spencer Greenberg, founder of <a href="https://www.clearerthinking.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ClearerThinking.org</a> has a process for working out such real life problems.<br /><br />

Let’s work through one here: how likely is it that you’ll enjoy listening to this episode?<br /><br />

The first step is to figure out your ‘prior probability’; what’s your estimate of how likely you are to enjoy the interview before getting any further evidence?<br /><br />

Other than applying common sense, one way to figure this out is called reference class forecasting: looking at similar cases and seeing how often something is true, on average.<br /><br />

Spencer is our first ever return guest. So one reference class might be, how many Spencer Greenberg episodes of the 80,000 Hours Podcast have you enjoyed so far? Being this specific limits bias in your answer, but with a sample size of at most 1 - you’d probably want to add more data points to reduce variability.<br /><br />

Zooming out, how many episodes of the 80,000 Hours Podcast have you enjoyed? Let’s say you’ve listened to 10, and enjoyed 8 of them. If so 8 out of 10 might be your prior probability.<br /><br />

But maybe the two you didn’t enjoy had something in common. If you’ve liked similar episodes in the past, you’d update in favour of expecting to enjoy it, and if you’ve disliked similar episodes in the past, you’d update negatively.<br /><br />

You can zoom out further; what fraction of long-form interview podcasts have you ever enjoyed?<br /><br />

Then you’d look to update whenever new information became available. Do the topics seem interesting? Did Spencer make a great point in the first 5 minutes? Was this description unbearably self-referential?<br /><br />

Speaking of the Question of Evidence: in a world where Spencer was not worth listening to, how likely is it that we’d invite him back for a second episode?<br /><br />

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/spencer-greenberg-bayesian-updating/?utm_campaign=podcast__spencer-greenberg-2&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

We’ll run through several diverse examples, and how to actually work out the changing probabilities as you update. But that’s only a fraction of the conversation. We also discuss:<br /><br />

* How could we generate 20-30 new happy thoughts a day? What would that do to our welfare?<br />
* What do people actually value? How do EAs differ from non EAs?<br />
* Why should we care about the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental values?<br />
* Would hedonic utilitarians really want to hook themselves up to happiness machines?<br />
* What types of activities are people generally under-confident about? Why?<br />
* When should you give a lot of weight to your prior belief?<br />
* When should we trust common sense?<br />
* Does power posing have any effect?<br />
* Are resumes worthless?<br />
* Did Trump explicitly collude with Russia? What are the odds of him getting re-elected?<br />
* What’s the probability that China and the US go to War in the 21st century?<br />
* How should we treat claims of expertise on diets?<br />
* Why were Spencer’s friends suspicious of Theranos for years?<br />
* How should we think about the placebo effect?<br />
* Does a shift towards rationality typically cause alienation from family and friends? How do you deal with that?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Will people who think carefully about how to maximize welfare eventually converge on the same views?<br><br>

The effective altruism community has spent a lot of time over the past 10 years debating how best to increase happiness and reduce suffering, and gradually narrowed in on the world’s poorest people, all animals capable of suffering, and future generations.<br><br>

Yew-Kwang Ng, Professor of Economics at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,  was independently working on this exact question since the 70s. Many of his conclusions have ended up foreshadowing what is now conventional wisdom within effective altruism - though other views he holds remain controversial or little-known.<br><br>

For instance, he thinks we ought to explore increasing pleasure via direct brain stimulation, and that genetic engineering may be an important tool for increasing happiness in the future.<br><br>

His work has suggested that the welfare of most wild animals is on balance negative and he thinks that in the future this is a problem humanity might work to solve. Yet he thinks that greatly improved conditions for farm animals could eventually justify eating meat.<br><br>

He has spent most of his life advocating for the view that happiness, broadly construed, is the only intrinsically valuable thing.<br><br>

If it’s true that careful researchers will converge as Prof Ng believes, these ideas may prove as prescient as his other, now widely accepted, opinions.<br><br>

<a href="https://80k.link/kwang-articles"><b>Link to our summary and appreciation of Kwang’s top publications and insights throughout a lifetime of research.</b></a><br><br>

Kwang has led an exceptional life. While in high school he was drawn to physics, mathematics, and philosophy, yet he chose to study economics because of his dream: to establish communism in an independent Malaya.<br><br>

But events in the Soviet Union and China, in addition to his burgeoning knowledge and academic appreciation of economics, would change his views about the practicability of communism. He would soon complete his journey from young revolutionary to academic economist, and eventually become a columnist writing in support of Deng Xiaoping’s Chinese economic reforms in the 80s.<br><br>

He got his PhD at Sydney University in 1971, and has since published over 250 refereed papers - covering economics, biology, politics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. <br><br>

He's most well-known for his work in welfare economics, and proposed ‘welfare biology’ as a new field of study. In 2007, he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Society of Australia, the highest award that the society bestows.<br><br>

In this episode we discuss how he developed some of his most unusual ideas and his fascinating life story, including:<br><br>

* Why Kwang believes that *’Happiness Is Absolute, Universal, Ultimate, Unidimensional, Cardinally Measurable and Interpersonally Comparable’*<br>

Yew-Kwang Ng, Professor of Economics at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, was independently working on this exact question since the 70s. Many of his conclusions have ended up foreshadowing what is now conventional wisdom within effective altruism - though other views he holds remain controversial or little-known. For instance, he thinks we ought to explore increasing pleasure via direct brain stimulation, and that genetic engineering may be an important tool for increasing happiness in the future. His work has suggested that the welfare of most wild animals is on balance negative and he thinks that in the future this is a problem humanity might work to solve. Yet he thinks that greatly improved conditions for farm animals could eventually justify eating meat. He has spent most of his life advocating for the view that happiness, broadly construed, is the only intrinsically valuable thing. If it’s true that careful researchers will converge as Prof Ng believes, these ideas may prove as prescient as his other, now widely accepted, opinions. Link to our summary and appreciation of Kwang’s top publications and insights throughout a lifetime of research. Kwang has led an exceptional life. While in high school he was drawn to physics, mathematics, and philosophy, yet he chose to study economics because of his dream: to establish communism in an independent Malaya. But events in the Soviet Union and China, in addition to his burgeoning knowledge and academic appreciation of economics, would change his views about the practicability of communism. He would soon complete his journey from young revolutionary to academic economist, and eventually become a columnist writing in support of Deng Xiaoping’s Chinese economic reforms in the 80s. He got his PhD at Sydney University in 1971, and has since published over 250 refereed papers - covering economics, biology, politics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. He's most well-known for his work in welfare economics, and proposed ‘welfare biology’ as a new field of study. In 2007, he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Economic Society of Australia, the highest award that the society bestows. Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. In this episode we discuss how he developed some of his most unusual ideas and his fascinating life story, including: * Why Kwang believes that *’Happiness Is Absolute, Universal, Ultimate, Unidimensional, Cardinally Measurable and Interpersonally Comparable’* * What are the most pressing questions in economics? * Did Kwang have to worry about censorship from the Chinese government when promoting market economics, or concern for animal welfare? * Welfare economics and where Kwang thinks it went wrong Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world’s most pressing problems and how to solve them: search for '80,000 Hours' in your podcasting app. The 80,000 Hours Podcast is produced by Keiran Harris.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>career,advice,social,impact,80000,Hours</itunes:keywords><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/80000HoursPodcast/~5/GHyA88FDxrk/476762145-80000-hours-yew-kwang-ng-anticipating-effective-altruism.mp3" length="114720780" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>https://backtracks.fm/80000hours/pr/8ae66c94-2a3c-11e9-bd0b-0ebe27f14992/476762145-80000-hours-yew-kwang-ng-anticipating-effective-altruism.mp3?s=1&amp;sd=1&amp;u=1549477529</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

         <description><![CDATA[What’s the value of preventing the death of a 5-year-old child, compared to a 20-year-old, or an 80-year-old?<br /><br />

The global health community has generally regarded the value as proportional to the number of health-adjusted life-years the person has remaining - but GiveWell, one of the world’s foremost charity evaluators, no longer uses that approach.<br><br>

They found that contrary to the years-remaining’ method, many of their staff actually value preventing the death of an adult more than preventing the death of a young child. However there’s plenty of disagreement: the team’s estimates of the relative value span a four-fold range.<br /><br />

As James Snowden - a research consultant at GiveWell - explains in this episode, there’s no way around making these controversial judgement calls based on limited information. If you try to ignore a question like this, you just implicitly take an unreflective stand on it instead. And for each charity they look into there’s 1 or 2 dozen of these highly uncertain parameters they need to estimate.<br /><br />

GiveWell has been trying to find better ways to make these decisions since its inception in 2007. Lives hang in the balance, so they want their staff to say what they really believe and bring their private knowledge to the table, rather than just defer to a imaginary consensus.<br /><br />

Their strategy is <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a massive spreadsheet</a> that lists dozens of things they need to estimate, and asking every staff member to give a figure and justification. Then once a year, the GiveWell team get together and try to identify what they really disagree about and think through what evidence it would take to change their minds.<br /><br />

Often the people who have the greatest familiarity with a particular intervention are the ones who drive the decision, as others defer to them. But the group can also end up with very different figures, based on different prior beliefs about moral issues and how the world works. In that case then use the median of everyone’s best guess to make their key decisions.<br /><br />

In making his estimate of the relative badness of dying at different ages, James specifically considered two factors: how many years of life do you lose, and how much interest do you have in those future years? Currently, James believes that the worst time for a person to die is around 8 years of age.<br /><br />

We discuss his experiences with such calculations, as well as a range of other topics:<br /><br />

* Why GiveWell’s recommendations have changed more than it looks.<br />
* What are the biggest research priorities for GiveWell at the moment?<br />
* How do you take into account the long-term knock-on effects from interventions?<br />
* If GiveWell's advice were going to end up being very different in a couple years' time, how might that happen?<br />
* Are there any charities that James thinks are really cost-effective which GiveWell hasn't funded yet?<br />
* How does domestic government spending in the developing world compare to effective charities?<br />
* What are the main challenges with policy related interventions?<br />
* How much time do you spend discovering new interventions?<br><br>

Today’s guest, Tanya Singh, sees herself as doing something like that every day. She’s Executive Assistant to one of her intellectual heroes who she believes is making a huge contribution to improving the world: Professor Bostrom at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute (FHI).<br><br>

She couldn’t get more work out of Bostrom with extra donations, as his salary is already easily covered. But with her superior abilities as an Executive Assistant, Tanya frees up hours of his time every week, essentially ‘buying’ more Bostrom in a way nobody else can. She also help manage FHI more generally, in so doing freeing up more than an hour of other staff time for each hour she works. This gives her the leverage to do more good than other people or other positions.<br><br>

“A good ops person doesn’t just allow you to scale linearly, but also can help figure out bottlenecks and solve problems such that the organization is able to do qualitatively different work, rather than just increase the total quantity”, Tara said.<br><br>

Tara’s right that buying time for people at the top of their field is just one path to impact, though it’s one Tanya says she finds highly motivating.

         <description><![CDATA[<em>"You don't need permission. You don't need to be allowed to do something that's not in your job description. If you think that it's gonna make your company or your organization more successful and more efficient, you can often just go and do it."</em><br><br>

How broken is the world? How inefficient is a typical organisation? Looking at Tara Mac Aulay’s life, the answer seems to be ‘very’.<br><br>

At 15 she took her first job - an entry-level position at a chain restaurant. Rather than accept her place, Tara took it on herself to massively improve the store’s shambolic staff scheduling and inventory management. After cutting staff costs 30% she was quickly promoted, and at 16 sent in to overhaul dozens of failing stores in a final effort to save them from closure.<br><br>

That’s just the first in a startling series of personal stories that take us to a hospital drug dispensary where pharmacists are wasting a third of their time, a chemotherapy ward in Bhutan that’s killing its patients rather than saving lives, and eventually the Centre for Effective Altruism, where Tara becomes CEO and leads it through start-up accelerator Y Combinator.<br><br>

In this episode Tara shows how the ability to do practical things, avoid major screw-ups, and design systems that scale, is both rare and precious. <br><br>

"Most people want to help others with their career, but what’s the best way to do that? Become a doctor? A politician? Work at a non-profit? How can any of us figure out the best way to use our skills to improve the world?<br><br>

Rob Wiblin is the Director of Research at 80,000 Hours, an organisation founded in Oxford in 2011, which aims to answer just this question and help talented people find their highest-impact career path. He hosts a popular podcast on ‘the world’s most pressing problems and how you can use your career to solve them’.<br><br>

After seven years of research, the 80,000 Hours team recommends against becoming a teacher, or a doctor, or working at most non-profits. And they claim their research shows some common careers do 10 or 100x as much good as others.<br><br>

80,000 Hours was one of the organisations that kicked off the effective altruism movement, was a Y Combinator-backed non-profit, and has already shifted over 80 million career hours through its advice.<br><br>

Joe caught up with Rob in Berkeley, California, to discuss how 80,000 Hours assesses which of the world’s problems are most pressing, how you can build career capital and succeed in any role, and why you could easily save more lives than a doctor - if you think carefully about your impact."<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[In 1991 Edwin Edwards won the Louisiana gubernatorial election. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering and received a 10 year invitation to Federal prison. The strange thing about that election? By 1991 Edwards was already notorious for his corruption. Actually, that’s not it.<br><br>

The truly strange thing is that Edwards was clearly the <em>good guy</em> in the race. How is that possible?<br><br>

His opponent was former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke.<br><br>

How could Louisiana end up having to choose between a criminal and a Nazi sympathiser?<br><br>

It’s not like they lacked other options: the state’s moderate incumbent governor Buddy Roemer ran for re-election. Polling showed that Roemer was massively preferred to both the career criminal and the career bigot, and would easily win a head-to-head election against either.<br><br>

Unfortunately, in Louisiana every candidate from every party competes in the first round, and the top two then go on to a second - a so-called ‘jungle primary’. Vote splitting squeezed out the middle, and meant that Roemer was eliminated in the first round.<br><br>

Louisiana voters were left with only terrible options, in a run-off election mostly remembered for the proliferation of bumper stickers reading <em>“Vote for the Crook. It’s Important.”</em><br><br>

We could look at this as a cultural problem, exposing widespread enthusiasm for bribery and racism that will take generations to overcome. But according to Aaron Hamlin, Executive Director of The Center for Election Science (CES), there’s a simple way to make sure we never have to elect someone hated by more than half the electorate: change how we vote.<br><br>

He advocates an alternative voting method called <em>approval voting</em>, in which you can vote for as many candidates as you want, not just one. That means that you can always support your honest favorite candidate, even when an election seems like a choice between the lesser of two evils.<br><br>

Vote splitting squeezed out the middle, and meant that Roemer was eliminated in the first round. Louisiana voters were left with only terrible options, in a run-off election mostly remembered for the proliferation of bumper stickers reading “Vote for the Crook. It’s Important.” We could look at this as a cultural problem, exposing widespread enthusiasm for bribery and racism that will take generations to overcome. But according to Aaron Hamlin, Executive Director of The Center for Election Science (CES), there’s a simple way to make sure we never have to elect someone hated by more than half the electorate: change how we vote. He advocates an alternative voting method called approval voting, in which you can vote for as many candidates as you want, not just one. That means that you can always support your honest favorite candidate, even when an election seems like a choice between the lesser of two evils. Full transcript, links to learn more, and summary of key points. If you'd like to meet Aaron he's doing events for CES in San Francisco, DC, Philadelphia, New York and Brooklyn over the next two weeks - RSVP here. While it might not seem sexy, this single change could transform politics. Approval voting is adored by voting researchers, who regard it as the best simple voting system available. Which do they regard as unquestionably the worst? First-past-the-post - precisely the disastrous system used and exported around the world by the US and UK. Aaron has a practical plan to spread approval voting across the US using ballot initiatives - and it just might be our best shot at making politics a bit less unreasonable. The Center for Election Science is a U.S. non-profit which aims to fix broken government by helping the world adopt smarter election systems. They recently received a $600,000 grant from the Open Philanthropy Project to scale up their efforts.

         <description><![CDATA[Joseph Stalin had a life-extension program dedicated to making himself immortal. What if he had succeeded? <br><br>

According to our last guest, <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-case-for-and-against-education/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg-2&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast">Bryan Caplan</a>, there’s an 80% chance that Stalin would still be ruling Russia today. Today’s guest disagrees.<br><br>

Like Stalin he has eyes for his own immortality - including an insurance plan that will cover the cost of cryogenically freezing himself after he dies - and thinks the technology to achieve it might be around the corner. <br><br>

Fortunately for humanity though, that guest is probably one of the nicest people on the planet: Dr Anders Sandberg of Oxford University. <br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-extending-life/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg-2&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript of the conversation, summary, and links to learn more.</b></a><br><br>

The potential availability of technology to delay or even stop ageing means this disagreement matters, so he has been trying to model what would really happen if both the very best and the very worst people in the world could live forever - among many other questions. <br><br>

Anders, who studies low-probability high-stakes risks and the impact of technological change at the Future of Humanity Institute, is the first guest to appear twice on the 80,000 Hours Podcast and might just be the most interesting academic at Oxford.  <br><br>

His research interests include more or less everything, and bucking the academic trend towards intense specialization has earned him a devoted fan base. <br><br>

In today’s episode we ask about Anders’ other recent papers, including:<br><br>

* Is it worth the money to freeze your body after death in the hope of future revival, like Anders has done? <br>
* How much is our perception of the risk of nuclear war biased by the fact that we wouldn’t be alive to think about it had one happened?<br>
* If biomedical research lets us slow down ageing would culture stagnate under the crushing weight of centenarians?<br>
* What long-shot drugs can people take in their 70s to stave off death?<br>
* Can science extend human (waking) life by cutting our need to sleep?<br>
* How bad would it be if a solar flare took down the electricity grid? Could it happen?<br>
* If you’re a scientist and you discover something exciting but dangerous, when should you keep it a secret and when should you share it?<br>
* Will lifelike robots make us more inclined to dehumanise one another?<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Bryan Caplan’s claim in *The Case Against Education* is striking: education doesn’t teach people much, we use little of what we learn, and college is mostly about trying to seem smarter than other people - so the government should slash education funding.<br><br>

It’s a dismaying - almost profane - idea, and one people are inclined to dismiss out of hand. But having read the book, I have to admit that Bryan can point to a surprising amount of evidence in his favour.<br><br>

After all, imagine this dilemma: you can have either a Princeton education without a diploma, or a Princeton diploma without an education. Which is the bigger benefit of college - learning or convincing people you’re smart? It’s not so easy to say.<br><br>

For this interview, I searched for the best counterarguments I could find and challenged Bryan on what seem like his weakest or most controversial claims.<br><br>

Wouldn’t defunding education be especially bad for capable but low income students? If you reduced funding for education, wouldn’t that just lower prices, and not actually change the number of years people study? Is it really true that students who drop out in their final year of college earn about the same as people who never go to college at all?<br><br>

What about studies that show that extra years of education boost IQ scores? And surely the early years of primary school, when you learn reading and arithmetic, *are* useful even if college isn’t.<br><br>

I then get his advice on who should study, what they should study, and where they should study, if he’s right that college is mostly about separating yourself from the pack. <br><br>

We then venture into some of Bryan’s other unorthodox views - like that immigration restrictions are a human rights violation, or that we should worry about the risk of global totalitarianism.<br><br>

Bryan is a Professor of Economics at George Mason University, and a blogger at *EconLog*.

         <description><![CDATA[If we have a study on the impact of a social program in a particular place and time, how confident can we be that we’ll get a similar result if we study the same program again somewhere else?<br /><br />

Dr Eva Vivalt is a lecturer in the Research School of Economics at the Australian National University. She compiled a huge database of impact evaluations in global development - including 15,024 estimates from 635 papers across 20 types of intervention - to help answer this question.<br><br>

Her finding: not confident at all.<br><br>

The typical study result differs from the average effect found in similar studies so far by almost 100%. That is to say, if all existing studies of a particular education program find that it improves test scores by 10 points - the next result is as likely to be negative or greater than 20 points, as it is to be between 0-20 points.<br><br>

She also observed that results from smaller studies done with an NGO - often pilot studies - were more likely to look promising. But when governments tried to implement scaled-up versions of those programs, their performance would drop considerably. <br /><br />

For researchers hoping to figure out what works and then take those programs global, these failures of generalizability and ‘external validity’ should be disconcerting.<br /><br />

Is ‘evidence-based development’ writing a cheque its methodology can’t cash? Should this make us invest less in empirical research, or more to get actually reliable results?<br /><br />

Or as some critics say, is interest in impact evaluation distracting us from more important issues, like national or macroeconomic reforms that can’t be easily trialled?<br /><br />

We discuss this as well as Eva’s other research, including Y Combinator’s basic income study where she is a principal investigator.<br /><br />

         <description><![CDATA[Part 2 out now: <b>#33 - Dr Anders Sandberg on what if we ended ageing, solar flares & the annual risk of nuclear war</b><br><br>

The universe is so vast, yet we don’t see any alien civilizations. If they exist, where are they? Oxford University’s Anders Sandberg has an original answer: they’re ‘sleeping’, and for a very compelling reason.<br><br>

Because of the thermodynamics of computation, the colder it gets, the more computations you can do. The universe is getting exponentially colder as it expands, and as the universe cools, one Joule of energy gets worth more and more. If they wait long enough this can become a 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x gain. So, if a civilization wanted to maximize its ability to perform computations – its best option might be to lie in wait for trillions of years.<br><br>

Why would a civilization want to maximise the number of computations they can do? Because conscious minds are probably generated by computation, so doing twice as many computations is like living twice as long, in subjective time. Waiting will allow them to generate vastly more science, art, pleasure, or almost anything else they are likely to care about.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-fermi-paradox/?utm_campaign=podcast__anders-sandberg&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast">Full transcript, related links, and key quotes.</a><br><br>

But there’s no point waking up to find another civilization has taken over and used up the universe’s energy. So they’ll need some sort of monitoring to protect their resources from potential competitors like us.<br><br>

It’s plausible that this civilization would want to keep the universe’s matter concentrated, so that each part would be in reach of the other parts, even after the universe’s expansion. But that would mean changing the trajectory of galaxies during this dormant period. That we don’t see anything like that makes it more likely that these aliens have local outposts throughout the universe, and we wouldn’t notice them until we broke their rules. But breaking their rules might be our last action as a species.<br><br>

This ‘aestivation hypothesis’ is the invention of Dr Sandberg, a Senior Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, where he looks at low-probability, high-impact risks, predicting the capabilities of future technologies and very long-range futures for humanity.<br><br>

In this incredibly fun conversation we cover this and other possible explanations to the Fermi paradox, as well as questions like:<br><br>

* Should we want optimists or pessimists working on our most important problems?<br>
* How should we reason about low probability, high impact risks?<br>
* Would a galactic civilization want to stop the stars from burning?<br>
* What would be the best strategy for exploring and colonising the universe?<br>
* How can you stay coordinated when you’re spread across different galaxies?<br>
* What should humanity decide to do with its future?<br><br>

If they exist, where are they? Oxford University’s Anders Sandberg has an original answer: they’re ‘sleeping’, and for a very compelling reason. Because of the thermodynamics of computation, the colder it gets, the more computations you can do. The universe is getting exponentially colder as it expands, and as the universe cools, one Joule of energy gets worth more and more. If they wait long enough this can become a 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x gain. So, if a civilization wanted to maximize its ability to perform computations – its best option might be to lie in wait for trillions of years. Why would a civilization want to maximise the number of computations they can do? Because conscious minds are probably generated by computation, so doing twice as many computations is like living twice as long, in subjective time. Waiting will allow them to generate vastly more science, art, pleasure, or almost anything else they are likely to care about. Full transcript, related links, and key quotes. But there’s no point waking up to find another civilization has taken over and used up the universe’s energy. So they’ll need some sort of monitoring to protect their resources from potential competitors like us. It’s plausible that this civilization would want to keep the universe’s matter concentrated, so that each part would be in reach of the other parts, even after the universe’s expansion. But that would mean changing the trajectory of galaxies during this dormant period. That we don’t see anything like that makes it more likely that these aliens have local outposts throughout the universe, and we wouldn’t notice them until we broke their rules. But breaking their rules might be our last action as a species. This ‘aestivation hypothesis’ is the invention of Dr Sandberg, a Senior Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, where he looks at low-probability, high-impact risks, predicting the capabilities of future technologies and very long-range futures for humanity. In this incredibly fun conversation we cover this and other possible explanations to the Fermi paradox, as well as questions like: * Should we want optimists or pessimists working on our most important problems? * How should we reason about low probability, high impact risks? * Would a galactic civilization want to stop the stars from burning? * What would be the best strategy for exploring and colonising the universe? * How can you stay coordinated when you’re spread across different galaxies? * What should humanity decide to do with its future?

         <description><![CDATA[A researcher is working on creating a new virus – one more dangerous than any that exist naturally. They believe they’re being as careful as possible. After all, if things go wrong, their own life and that of their colleagues will be in danger. But if an accident is capable of triggering a global pandemic – hundreds of millions of lives might be at risk. How much additional care will the researcher actually take in the face of such a staggering death toll?<br><br>

In a new paper Dr Owen Cotton-Barratt, a Research Fellow at Oxford University’s Future of Humanity Institute, argues it’s impossible to expect them to make the correct adjustments. If they have an accident that kills 5 people – they’ll feel extremely bad. If they have an accident that kills 500 million people, they’ll feel even worse – but there’s no way for them to feel 100 million times worse. The brain simply doesn’t work that way.<br><br>

So, rather than relying on individual judgement, we could create a system that would lead to better outcomes: research liability insurance. <br><br>

Once an insurer assesses how much damage a particular project is expected to cause and with what likelihood – in order to proceed, the researcher would need to take out insurance against the predicted risk. In return, the insurer promises that they’ll pay out – potentially tens of billions of dollars – if things go really badly.<br><br>

This would force researchers think very carefully about the cost and benefits of their work – and incentivize the insurer to demand safety standards on a level that individual researchers can’t be expected to impose themselves.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[How about this for a movie idea: a main character has to prevent a new contagious strain of Ebola spreading around the world. She’s the best of the best. So good in fact, that her work on early detection systems contains the strain at its source. Ten minutes into the movie, we see the results of her work – nothing happens. Life goes on as usual. She continues to be amazingly competent, and nothing continues to go wrong. Fade to black. Roll credits.<br><br>

If your job is to prevent catastrophes, success is when nobody has to pay attention to you. But without regular disasters to remind authorities why they hired you in the first place, they can’t tell if you’re actually achieving anything. And when budgets come under pressure you may find that success condemns you to the chopping block. <br><br>

Dr Tom Inglesby, Director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, worries this may be about to happen to the scientists working on the ‘Global Health Security Agenda’.<br><br>

In 2014 Ebola showed the world why we have to detect and contain new diseases before they spread, and that when it comes to contagious diseases the nations of the world sink or swim together. Fifty countries decided to work together to make sure all their health systems were up to the challenge. Back then Congress provided 5 years’ funding to help some of the world’s poorest countries build the basic health security infrastructure necessary to control pathogens before they could reach the US.<br><br>

But with Ebola fading from public memory and no recent tragedies to terrify us, Congress may not renew that funding and the project could fall apart. (Learn more about how you can help: http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/protect-us-investments-global-health-security/ )<br><br>

But there are positive signs as well - the center Inglesby leads recently received a $16 million grant from the Open Philanthropy Project to further their work preventing global catastrophes. It also runs the [Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Fellowship](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/emergingbioleaders/) to train the next generation of biosecurity experts for the US government. And Inglesby regularly testifies to Congress on the threats we all face and how to address them.<br><br>

In this in-depth interview we try to provide concrete guidance for listeners who want to to pursue a career in health security. Some of the topics we cover include:<br><br>

* Should more people in medicine work on security?<br>
* What are the top jobs for people who want to improve health security and how do they work towards getting them?<br>
* What people can do to protect funding for the Global Health Security Agenda.<br>
* Should we be more concerned about natural or human caused pandemics? Which is more neglected?<br>
* Should we be allocating more attention and resources to global catastrophic risk scenarios?<br>
* Why are senior figures reluctant to prioritize one project or area at the expense of another?  <br>
* What does Tom think about the idea that in the medium term, human-caused pandemics will pose a far greater risk than natural pandemics, and so we should focus on specific counter-measures?<br>
* Are the main risks and solutions understood, and it’s just a matter of implementation? Or is the principal task to identify and understand them?<br>
* How is the current US government performing in these areas?<br>
* Which agencies are empowered to think about low probability high magnitude events?<br>
And more...<br><br>

Today’s episode is hosted by Natalie Cargill, a barrister in London with a background in animal advocacy. Natalie and Marie also discuss:<br><br>

* Why Marie switched from being a vet to developing clean meat<br>
* For people who want to dedicate themselves to animal welfare, how does working in clean meat fare compared to other career options? How can people get jobs in the area?<br>
* How did this become an established field?<br>

* How easy will it be to get consumer acceptance?<br>
* How valuable would extra funding be for cellular agriculture?<br>
* Can we use genetic modification to speed up the process?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[On February 2, 1685, England’s King Charles II was struck by a sudden illness. Fortunately his physicians were the best of the best. To reassure the public they kept them abreast of  the King’s treatment regimen. King Charles was made to swallow a toxic metal; had blistering agents applied to his scalp; had pigeon droppings attached to his feet; was prodded with a red-hot poker; given forty drops of ooze from “the skull of a man that was never buried”; and, finally, had crushed stones from the intestines of an East Indian goat forced down his throat. Sadly, despite these heroic efforts, he passed away the following week. <br><br>

Why did the doctors go this far?<br><br>

Prof, Robin Hanson, Associate Professor of Economics at George Mason University suspects that on top of any medical beliefs they also had a hidden motive: it needed to be clear, to the king and the public, that the physicians cared enormously about saving His Royal Majesty. Only by going ‘all out’ would they be protected against accusations of negligence should the King die. <br><br>

If you believe Hanson, the same desire to be seen to care about our family and friends explains much of what’s perverse about our medical system today.<br><br>

And not just medicine - Robin thinks we’re mostly kidding ourselves when we say our charities exist to help others, our schools exist to educate students and our politics are about choosing wise policies. <br><br>

So important are hidden motives for navigating our social world that we have to deny them to ourselves, lest we accidentally reveal them to others.<br><br>

Robin is a polymath economist, who has come up with surprising and novel insight in a range of fields including psychology, politics and futurology. In this extensive episode we discuss his latest book with Kevin Simler, *The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life*, but also:<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[How honest should we be? How helpful? How friendly? If our society claims to value honesty, for instance, but in reality accepts an awful lot of lying – should we go along with those lax standards? Or, should we attempt to set a new norm for ourselves?<br><br>

Dr Stefan Schubert, a researcher at the Social Behaviour and Ethics Lab at Oxford University, has been modelling this in the context of the effective altruism community. He thinks people trying to improve the world should hold themselves to very high standards of integrity, because their minor sins can impose major costs on the thousands of others who share their goals.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/03/stefan-schubert-considering-considerateness/?utm_campaign=podcast__stefan-schubert&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Summary, related links and full transcript.</b></a><br><br>

In addition, when a norm is uniquely important to our situation, we should be willing to question society and come up with something different and hopefully better.<br><br>

But in other cases, we can be better off sticking with whatever our culture expects, both to save time, avoid making mistakes, and ensure others can predict our behaviour.<br><br>

In this interview Stefan offers a range of views on the projects and culture that make up ‘effective altruism’ - including where it’s going right and where it’s going wrong.<br><br>

Stefan did his PhD in formal epistemology, before moving on to a postdoc in political rationality at the London School of Economics, while working on advocacy projects to improve truthfulness among politicians. At the time the interview was recorded Stefan was a researcher at the Centre for Effective Altruism in Oxford. <br><br>

We discuss:<br><br>

* Should we trust our own judgement more than others’?<br>
* How hard is it to improve political discourse?<br>
* What should we make of well-respected academics writing articles that seem to be completely misinformed?<br>
* How is effective altruism (EA) changing? What might it be doing wrong?<br>
* How has Stefan’s view of EA changed?<br>
* Should EA get more involved in politics, or steer clear of it? Would it be a bad idea for a talented graduate to get involved in party politics?<br>
* How much should we cooperate with those with whom we have disagreements?<br>
* What good reasons are there to be inconsiderate?<br>
* Should effective altruism potentially focused on a more narrow range of problems?<br><br>

*The 80,000 Hours podcast is produced by Keiran Harris.*<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[How people kill themselves varies enormously depending on which means are most easily available. In the United States, suicide by firearm stands out. In Hong Kong, where most people live in high rise buildings, jumping from a height is more common. And in some countries in Asia and Africa with many poor agricultural communities, the leading means is drinking pesticide.<br><br>

There’s a good chance you’ve never heard of this issue before. And yet, of the 800,000 people who kill themselves globally each year 20% die from pesticide self-poisoning.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/03/leah-utyasheva-pesticide-suicide-prevention/?utm_campaign=podcast__leah-utyasheva&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript, summary and links to articles discussed in today's show.</b></a><br><br>

Research suggests most people who try to kill themselves with pesticides reflect on the decision for less than 30 minutes, and that less than 10% of those who don't die the first time around will try again.<br><br>

Unfortunately, the fatality rate from pesticide ingestion is 40% to 70%.<br><br>

Having such dangerous chemicals near people's homes is therefore an enormous public health issue not only for the direct victims, but also the partners and children they leave behind.<br><br>

Fortunately researchers like Dr Leah Utyasheva have figured out a very cheap way to massively reduce pesticide suicide rates.<br><br>

In this episode, Leah and I discuss:<br><br>

* How do you prevent pesticide suicide and what’s the evidence it works?<br>
* How do you know that most people attempting suicide don’t want to die?<br>
* What types of events are causing people to have the crises that lead to attempted suicide?<br>
* How much money does it cost to save a life in this way?<br>
* How do you estimate the probability of getting law reform passed in a particular country?<br>
* Have you generally found politicians to be sympathetic to the idea of banning these pesticides? What are their greatest reservations?<br>
* The comparison of getting policy change rather than helping person-by-person<br>
* The importance of working with locals in places like India and Nepal, rather than coming in exclusively as outsiders<br>
* What are the benefits of starting your own non-profit versus joining an existing org and persuading them of the merits of the cause?<br>
* Would Leah in general recommend starting a new charity? Is it more exciting than it is scary?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[The Green Revolution averted mass famine during the 20th century. The contraceptive pill gave women unprecedented freedom in planning their own lives. Both are widely recognised as scientific breakthroughs that transformed the world. But few know that those breakthroughs only happened when they did because of a philanthropist willing to take a risky bet on a new idea.<br><br>

Today’s guest, Holden Karnofsky, has been looking for philanthropy’s biggest success stories because he’s Executive Director of the Open Philanthropy Project, which gives away over $100 million per year - and he’s hungry for big wins.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/02/holden-karnofsky-open-philanthropy/?utm_campaign=podcast__holden-karnofsky&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript, related links, job opportunities and summary of the interview.</b></a><br><br>

In the 1940s, poverty reduction overseas was not a big priority for many. But the Rockefeller Foundation decided to fund agricultural scientists to breed much better crops for the developing world - thereby massively increasing their food production.<br><br>

In the 1950s, society was a long way from demanding effective birth control. Activist Margaret Sanger had the idea for the pill, and endocrinologist Gregory Pincus the research team – but they couldn’t proceed without a $40,000 research check from biologist and women’s rights activist Katherine McCormick.<br><br>

In both cases, it was philanthropists rather than governments that led the way.<br><br>

The reason, according to Holden, is that while governments have enormous resources, they’re constrained by only being able to fund reasonably sure bets. Philanthropists can transform the world by filling the gaps government leaves - but to seize that opportunity they have to hire outstanding researchers, think long-term and be willing to fail most of the time. <br><br>

Holden knows more about this type of giving than almost anyone. As founder of GiveWell and then the Open Philanthropy Project, he has been working feverishly since 2007 to find outstanding giving opportunities. This practical experience has made him one of the most influential figures in the development of the school of thought that has come to be known as effective altruism.<br><br>

We’ve recorded this episode now because [the Open Philanthropy Project is hiring](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/get-involved/jobs) for a large number of positions, which we think would allow the right person to have a very large positive influence on the world. They’re looking for a large number of entry lever researchers to train up, 3 specialist researchers into potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence, as well as a Director of Operations, Operations Associate and General Counsel.<br><br>

But the conversation goes well beyond specifics about these jobs. We also discuss:<br><br>

* How did they pick the problems they focus on, and how will they change over time?<br>
* What would Holden do differently if he were starting Open Phil again today?<br>
* What can we learn from the history of philanthropy?<br>
* What makes a good Program Officer.<br>
* The importance of not letting hype get ahead of the science in an emerging field.<br>
* The importance of honest feedback for philanthropists, and the difficulty getting it.<br>
* How do they decide what’s above the bar to fund, and when it’s better to hold onto the money?<br>
* How philanthropic funding can most influence politics.<br>
* What Holden would say to a new billionaire who wanted to give away most of their wealth.<br>
* Why Open Phil is building a research field around the safe development of artificial intelligence<br>
* Why they invested in OpenAI.<br>
* Academia’s faulty approach to answering practical questions.<br>
* What potential utopias do people most want, according to opinion polls? <br><br>

The contraceptive pill gave women unprecedented freedom in planning their own lives. Both are widely recognised as scientific breakthroughs that transformed the world. But few know that those breakthroughs only happened when they did because of a philanthropist willing to take a risky bet on a new idea. Today’s guest, Holden Karnofsky, has been looking for philanthropy’s biggest success stories because he’s Executive Director of the Open Philanthropy Project, which gives away over $100 million per year - and he’s hungry for big wins. Full transcript, related links, job opportunities and summary of the interview. In the 1940s, poverty reduction overseas was not a big priority for many. But the Rockefeller Foundation decided to fund agricultural scientists to breed much better crops for the developing world - thereby massively increasing their food production. In the 1950s, society was a long way from demanding effective birth control. Activist Margaret Sanger had the idea for the pill, and endocrinologist Gregory Pincus the research team – but they couldn’t proceed without a $40,000 research check from biologist and women’s rights activist Katherine McCormick. In both cases, it was philanthropists rather than governments that led the way. The reason, according to Holden, is that while governments have enormous resources, they’re constrained by only being able to fund reasonably sure bets. Philanthropists can transform the world by filling the gaps government leaves - but to seize that opportunity they have to hire outstanding researchers, think long-term and be willing to fail most of the time. Holden knows more about this type of giving than almost anyone. As founder of GiveWell and then the Open Philanthropy Project, he has been working feverishly since 2007 to find outstanding giving opportunities. This practical experience has made him one of the most influential figures in the development of the school of thought that has come to be known as effective altruism. We’ve recorded this episode now because [the Open Philanthropy Project is hiring](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/get-involved/jobs) for a large number of positions, which we think would allow the right person to have a very large positive influence on the world. They’re looking for a large number of entry lever researchers to train up, 3 specialist researchers into potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence, as well as a Director of Operations, Operations Associate and General Counsel. But the conversation goes well beyond specifics about these jobs. We also discuss: * How did they pick the problems they focus on, and how will they change over time? * What would Holden do differently if he were starting Open Phil again today? * What can we learn from the history of philanthropy? * What makes a good Program Officer. * The importance of not letting hype get ahead of the science in an emerging field. * The importance of honest feedback for philanthropists, and the difficulty getting it. * How do they decide what’s above the bar to fund, and when it’s better to hold onto the money? * How philanthropic funding can most influence politics. * What Holden would say to a new billionaire who wanted to give away most of their wealth. * Why Open Phil is building a research field around the safe development of artificial intelligence * Why they invested in OpenAI. * Academia’s faulty approach to answering practical questions. * What potential utopias do people most want, according to opinion polls?

         <description><![CDATA[Before the US Civil War, it was easier for the North to morally oppose slavery. Why? Because unlike the South they weren’t profiting much from its existence. The fight for abolition was partly won because many no longer saw themselves as having a selfish stake in its continuation.<br><br>

Bruce Friedrich, executive director of The Good Food Institute (GFI), thinks the same may be true in the fight against speciesism. 98% of people currently eat meat. But if eating meat stops being part of most people’s daily lives -- it should be a lot easier to convince them that farming practices are just as cruel as they look, and that the suffering of these animals really matters.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/2018/02/bruce-friedrich-good-food-institute/?utm_campaign=podcast__bruce-friedrich&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript, related links, job opportunities and summary of the interview.</b></a><br><br>

That’s why GFI is “working with scientists, investors, and entrepreneurs” to create plant-based meat, dairy and eggs as well as clean meat alternatives to animal products. In 2016, Animal Charity Evaluators named GFI one of its recommended charities.<br><br>

In this interview I’m joined by my colleague Natalie Cargill, and we ask Bruce about:<br><br>

* What’s the best meat replacement product out there right now?<br>
* How effective is meat substitute research for people who want to reduce animal suffering as much as possible?<br>
* When will we get our hands on clean meat? And why does Bruce call it clean meat, rather than in vitro meat or cultured meat?<br>
* What are the challenges of producing something structurally identical to meat?<br>
* Can clean meat be healthier than conventional meat?<br>
* Do plant-based alternatives have a better shot at success than clean meat?<br>
* Is there a concern that, even if the product is perfect, people still won’t eat it? Why might that happen?<br>
* What’s it like being a vegan in a family made up largely of hunters and meat-eaters?<br>
* What kind of pushback should be expected from the meat industry?<br><br>

Samantha serves as Senior Director of The Global Nuclear Policy Program at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and warns that the chances of a nuclear terrorist attack are alarmingly high.

* In the case of nuclear war, what fraction of the world's population would die?<br>
* What is the biggest nuclear threat?<br>
* How concerned should we be about North Korea?<br>
* How often has the world experienced nuclear near misses?<br>

After reflecting on cases like this, he decided that to not engage with a problem is an active choice, one whose consequences he is just as morally responsible for as if he were directly involved. On top of his life philosophy we also discuss: * The benefits of working in a top academic environment * How best to start a career in global development * Are RCTs worth the money? Should we focus on big picture policy change instead? Or more economic theory? * How the delivery standards of nonprofits compare to top universities * Why he doesn’t enjoy living in the San Francisco bay area * How can we fix the problem of most published research being false? * How good a career path is data science? * How important is experience in development versus technical skills? * How he learned much of what he needed to know in the army * How concerned should effective altruists be about burnout?

Throughout history we’ve consistently believed, as common sense, truly horrifying things by today’s standards.

If our morality is tied to common sense intuitions, we’re probably just preserving these biases and moral errors. Instead we need to develop a moral view that criticises common sense intuitions, and gives us a chance to move beyond them. And if humanity is going to spread to the stars it could be worth dedicating hundreds or thousands of years to moral reflection, lest we spread our errors far and wide.<br><br>
 
Will is an Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University, author of Doing Good Better, and one of the co-founders of the effective altruism community. In this interview we discuss a wide range of topics:<br><br>
 
* How would we go about a ‘long reflection’ to fix our moral errors?<br>
* Will’s forthcoming book on how one should reason and act if you don't know which moral theory is correct. What are the practical implications of so-called ‘moral uncertainty’?<br>
* If we basically solve existential risks, what does humanity do next?<br>
* What are some of Will’s most unusual philosophical positions?<br>
* What are the best arguments for and against utilitarianism?<br>
* Given disagreements among philosophers, how much should we believe the findings of philosophy as a field?<br>
* What are some the biases we should be aware of within academia?<br>
* What are some of the downsides of becoming a professor?<br>
* What are the merits of becoming a philosopher?<br>
* How does the media image of EA differ to the actual goals of the community?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[In the 40s and 50s neoliberalism was a fringe movement within economics. But by the 80s it had become a dominant school of thought in public policy, and achieved major policy changes across the English speaking world. How did this happen?<br><br>

Michelle Hutchinson is working to get a different set of ideas a hearing in academia by setting up the Global Priorities Institute (GPI) at Oxford University. The Institute, which is <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/opportunities/">currently hiring for three roles</a>, aims to bring together outstanding philosophers and economists to research how to most improve the world. The hope is that it will spark widespread academic engagement with effective altruist thinking, which will hone the ideas and help them gradually percolate into society more broadly.<br><br>

Its <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gpi-research-agenda.pdf">research agenda</a> includes questions like:<br><br>

* How do we compare the good done by focussing on really different types of causes?<br>
* How does saving lives actually affect the world relative to other things we could do?<br>
* What are the biggest wins governments should be focussed on getting?<br><br>

Before moving to GPI, Michelle was the Executive Director of Giving What We Can and a founding figure of the effective altruism movement. She has a PhD in Applied Ethics from Oxford on prioritization and global health.<br><br>

We discuss:<br><br>

* What is global priorities research and why does it matter?<br>
* How is effective altruism seen in academia? Is it important to convince academics of the value of your work, or is it OK to ignore them?<br>
* Operating inside a university is quite expensive, so is it even worth doing? Who can pay for this kind of thing?<br>
* How hard is it to do something innovative inside a university? How serious are the administrative and other barriers?<br>
* Is it harder to fundraise for a new institute, or hire the right people?<br>
* Have other social movements benefitted from having a prominent academic arm?<br>
* How can people prepare themselves to get research roles at a place like GPI?<br>

         <description><![CDATA[Prof Philip Tetlock is a social science legend. Over forty years he has researched whose predictions we can trust, whose we can’t and why - and developed methods that allow all of us to be better at predicting the future.<br><br>

After the Iraq WMDs fiasco, the US intelligence services hired him to figure out how to ensure they’d never screw up that badly again. The result of that work – <em>Superforecasting</em> – was a media sensation in 2015.<br><br>

<a href="https://80000hours.org/2017/11/prof-tetlock-predicting-the-future/?utm_campaign=podcast__phil-tetlock&utm_source=80000+Hours+Podcast&utm_medium=podcast"><b>Full transcript, brief summary, apply for coaching and links to learn more.</b></a><br><br>

It described Tetlock’s Good Judgement Project, which found forecasting methods so accurate they beat everyone else in open competition, including thousands of people in the intelligence services with access to classified information.<br><br>

Today he’s working to develop the best forecasting process ever, by combining top human and machine intelligence in the <a href="https://www.hybridforecasting.com/">Hybrid Forecasting Competition</a>, which you can sign up and participate in.<br><br>

We start by describing his key findings, and then push to the edge of what is known about how to foresee the unforeseeable:<br><br>

* Should people who want to be right just adopt the views of experts rather than apply their own judgement?<br>
* Why are Berkeley undergrads worse forecasters than dart-throwing chimps?<br>
* Should I keep my political views secret, so it will be easier to change them later?<br>
* How can listeners contribute to his latest cutting-edge research?<br>
* What do we know about our accuracy at predicting low-probability high-impact disasters?<br>
* Does his research provide an intellectual basis for populist political movements?<br>
* Was the Iraq War caused by bad politics, or bad intelligence methods?<br>
* What can we learn about forecasting from the 2016 election?<br>
* Can experience help people avoid overconfidence and underconfidence?<br>
* When does an AI easily beat human judgement?<br>
* Could more accurate forecasting methods make the world more dangerous?<br>
* How much does demographic diversity line up with cognitive diversity?<br>
* What are the odds we’ll go to war with China?<br>
* Should we let prediction tournaments run most of the government?<br><br>

We start by describing his key findings, and then push to the edge of what is known about how to foresee the unforeseeable:<br><br>

* Should people who want to be right just adopt the views of experts rather than apply their own judgement?<br>
* Why are Berkeley undergrads worse forecasters than dart-throwing chimps?<br>
* Should I keep my political views secret, so it will be easier to change them later?<br>
* How can listeners contribute to his latest cutting-edge research?<br>
* What do we know about our accuracy at predicting low-probability high-impact disasters?<br>
* Does his research provide an intellectual basis for populist political movements?<br>
* Was the Iraq War caused by bad politics, or bad intelligence methods?<br>
* What can we learn about forecasting from the 2016 election?<br>
* Can experience help people avoid overconfidence and underconfidence?<br>
* When does an AI easily beat human judgement?<br>
* Could more accurate forecasting methods make the world more dangerous?<br>
* How much does demographic diversity line up with cognitive diversity?<br>
* What are the odds we’ll go to war with China?<br>
* Should we let prediction tournaments run most of the government?<br><br>

Over forty years he has researched whose predictions we can trust, whose we can’t and why - and developed methods that allow all of us to be better at predicting the future. After the Iraq WMDs fiasco, the US intelligence services hired him to figure out how to ensure they’d never screw up that badly again. The result of that work – Superforecasting – was a media sensation in 2015. Full transcript, brief summary, apply for coaching and links to learn more.

         <description><![CDATA[What if you knew that ducks were being killed with pitchforks? Rabbits dumped alive into containers? Or pigs being strangled with forklifts? Would you be willing to go undercover to expose the crime?<br><br>

That’s a real question that confronts volunteers at Animal Equality (AE). In this episode we speak to Sharon Nunez and Jose Valle, who founded AE in 2006 and then grew it into a multi-million dollar international animal rights organisation. They’ve been chosen as one of the most effective animal protection orgs in the world by Animal Charity Evaluators for the last 3 consecutive years.<br><br>

In addition to undercover investigations AE has also designed a 3D virtual-reality farm experience called iAnimal360. People get to experience being trapped in a cage – in a room designed to kill then - and can’t just look away. How big an impact is this having on users?<br><br>

Sharon Nuñez and Jose Valle also tackle:<br><br>

* How do they track their goals and metrics week to week?<br>
* How much does an undercover investigation cost?<br>
* Why don’t people donate more to factory farmed animals, given that they’re the vast majority of animals harmed directly by humans?<br>
* How risky is it to attempt to build a career in animal advocacy?<br>
* What led to a change in their focus from bullfighting in Spain to animal farming?<br>
* How does working with governments or corporate campaigns compare with early strategies like creating new vegans/vegetarians?<br>
* Has their very rapid growth been difficult to handle?<br>
* What should our listeners study or do if they want to work in this area?<br>
* How can we get across the message that horrific cases are a feature - not a bug - of factory farming?<br>

Enter MIT’s Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). Since 2003 they’ve conducted experiments to figure out what policies actually help recipients, and then tried to get them implemented by governments and non-profits.<br><br>

Claire Walsh leads J-PAL’s Government Partnership Initiative, which works to evaluate policies and programs in collaboration with developing world governments, scale policies that have been shown to work, and generally promote a culture of evidence-based policymaking.<br><br>

We discussed (her views only, not J-PAL’s):<br><br>

* How can they get evidence backed policies adopted? Do politicians in the developing world even care whether their programs actually work? Is the norm evidence-based policy, or policy-based evidence?<br>
* Is evidence-based policy an evidence-based strategy itself?<br>
* Which policies does she think would have a particularly large impact on human welfare relative to their cost?<br>
* How did she come to lead one of J-PAL’s departments at 29?<br>
* How do you evaluate the effectiveness of energy and environment programs (Walsh’s area of expertise), and what are the standout approaches in that area?<br>
* 80,000 Hours has warned people about the downsides of starting your career in a non-profit. Walsh started her career in a non-profit and has thrived, so are we making a mistake?<br>
* Other than J-PAL, what are the best places to work in development? What are the best subjects to study? Where can you go network to break into the sector?<br>
* Is living in poverty as bad as we think?<br><br>

And plenty of other things besides.<br><br>

We haven’t run an RCT to test whether this episode will actually help your career, but I suggest you listen anyway. Trust my intuition on this one.]]></description>

         <description><![CDATA[<em>“When you're in the middle of a crisis and you have to ask for money, you're already too late.”</em><br><br>

That’s Dr Beth Cameron, who leads <em>Global Biological Policy and Programs</em> at the Nuclear Threat Initiative.<br><br>

Beth should know. She has years of experience preparing for and fighting the diseases of our nightmares, on the <em>White House Ebola Taskforce</em>, in the <em>National Security Council</em> staff, and as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for <em>Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs</em>.<br><br>

Unfortunately, the countries of the world aren’t prepared for a crisis - and like children crowded into daycare, there’s a good chance something will make us all sick at once.<br><br>

During past pandemics countries have dragged their feet over who will pay to contain them, or struggled to move people and supplies where they needed to be. At the same time advanced biotechnology threatens to make it possible for terrorists to bring back smallpox - or create something even worse.<br><br>

In this interview we look at the current state of play in disease control, what needs to change, and how you can build the career capital necessary to make those changes yourself. That includes:<br><br>

* What and where to study, and where to begin a career in pandemic preparedness. Below you’ll find a lengthy list of people and places mentioned in the interview, and others we’ve had recommended to us.<br>
* How the Nuclear Threat Initiative, with just 50 people, collaborates with governments around the world to reduce the risk of nuclear or biological catastrophes, and whether they might want to hire you.<br>
* The best strategy for containing pandemics.<br>
* Why we lurch from panic, to neglect, to panic again when it comes to protecting ourselves from contagious diseases.<br>
* Current reform efforts within the World Health Organisation, and attempts to prepare partial vaccines ahead of time.<br>
* Which global health security groups most impress Beth, and what they’re doing.<br>
* What new technologies could be invented to make us safer.<br>
* Whether it’s possible to help solve the problem through mass advocacy.<br>
* Much more besides.<br><br>

* What and where to study, and where to begin a career in pandemic preparedness. Below you’ll find a lengthy list of people and places mentioned in the interview, and others we’ve had recommended to us.<br>
* How the Nuclear Threat Initiative, with just 50 people, collaborates with governments around the world to reduce the risk of nuclear or biological catastrophes, and whether they might want to hire you.<br>
* The best strategy for containing pandemics.<br>
* Why we lurch from panic, to neglect, to panic again when it comes to protecting ourselves from contagious diseases.<br>
* Current reform efforts within the World Health Organisation, and attempts to prepare partial vaccines ahead of time.<br>
* Which global health security groups most impress Beth, and what they’re doing.<br>
* What new technologies could be invented to make us safer.<br>
* Whether it’s possible to help solve the problem through mass advocacy.<br>
* Much more besides.<br><br>

Beth should know. She has years of experience preparing for and fighting the diseases of our nightmares, on the White House Ebola Taskforce, in the National Security Council staff, and as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs. Summary, list of career opportunities, extra links to learn more and coaching application. Unfortunately, the countries of the world aren’t prepared for a crisis - and like children crowded into daycare, there’s a good chance something will make us all sick at once. During past pandemics countries have dragged their feet over who will pay to contain them, or struggled to move people and supplies where they needed to be. At the same time advanced biotechnology threatens to make it possible for terrorists to bring back smallpox - or create something even worse.

What is the best, state-of-the-art therapy for depression? How can we make academics more intellectually honest, so we can actually trust their findings? How can we speed up social science research ten-fold? Do most startups improve the world, or make it worse?<br><br>

If you’re interested in these question, this interview is for you.<br><br>

A scientist, entrepreneur, writer and mathematician, Spencer Greenberg is constantly working to create tools to speed up and improve research and critical thinking. These include:<br><br>

* Rapid public opinion surveys to find out what most people actually think about animal consciousness, farm animal welfare, the impact of developing world charities and the likelihood of extinction by various different means;<br>
* Tools to enable social science research to be run en masse very cheaply;<br>
* ClearerThinking.org, a highly popular site for improving people’s judgement and decision-making;<br>
* Ways to transform data analysis methods to ensure that papers only show true findings;<br>
* Innovative research methods;<br>
* Ways to decide which research projects are actually worth pursuing.<br><br>

In this interview, Spencer discusses all of these and more. If you don’t feel like listening, that just shows that you have poor judgement and need to benefit from his wisdom even more!<br><br>

Following a PhD in philosophy, Nick works to figure out where money can do the most good. He’s been involved in major grants in a wide range of areas, including ending factory farming through technological innovation, safeguarding the world from advances in biotechnology and artificial intelligence, and spreading rational compassion.<br><br>

This episode is a tour through some of the toughest questions ‘effective altruists’ face when figuring out how to best improve the world, including:<br><br>

* * Should we mostly try to help people currently alive, or future generations? Nick studied this question for years in his PhD thesis, <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE">On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</a>. (The first 31 minutes is a snappier version of <a href="https://80k.link/toby-ord-from-nick">my conversation with Toby Ord</a>.)<br>
* Is clean meat (aka *in vitro* meat) technologically feasible any time soon, or should we be looking for plant-based alternatives?<br>
* What are the greatest risks to human civilisation?<br>
* To stop malaria is it more cost-effective to use technology to <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/miscellaneous/target-malaria-general-support">eliminate mosquitos</a> than to distribute bed nets?<br>
* Should people who want to improve the future work for changes that will be very useful in a specific scenario, or just generally try to improve how well humanity makes decisions?<br>
* What specific jobs should our listeners take in order for Nick to be able to spend more money in useful ways to improve the world?<br>
* Should we expect the future to be better if the economy grows more quickly - or more slowly?<br><br>

In this episode of the 80,000 Hours Podcast Christine Peterson takes us back to her youth in the Bay Area, the ideas she encountered there, and what the dreamers she met did as they grew up. We also discuss how she came up with the term ‘open source software’ (and how she had to get someone else to propose it).<br><br>

Today Christine helps runs the Foresight Institute, which fills a gap left by for-profit technology companies – predicting how new revolutionary technologies could go wrong, and ensuring we steer clear of the downsides.<br><br>

We dive into:<br><br>

* Whether the poor security of computer systems poses a catastrophic risk for the world. Could all our essential services be taken down at once? And if so, what can be done about it?<br>
* Can technology ‘move fast and break things’ without eventually breaking the world? Would it be better for technology to advance more quickly, or more slowly?<br>
* How Christine came up with the term ‘open source software’ (and why someone else had to propose it).<br>
* Will AIs designed for wide-scale automated hacking make computers more or less secure?<br>
* Would it be good to radically extend human lifespan? Is it sensible to cryogenically freeze yourself in the hope of being resurrected in the future?<br>
* Could atomically precise manufacturing (nanotechnology) really work? Why was it initially so controversial and why did people stop worrying about it?<br>
* Should people who try to do good in their careers work long hours and take low salaries? Or should they take care of themselves first of all?<br>
* How she thinks the the effective altruism community resembles the scene she was involved with when she was wrong, and where it might be going wrong.<br><br>

Full transcript, coaching application form, overview of the conversation, and extra resources to learn more: In this episode of the 80,000 Hours Podcast Christine Peterson takes us back to her youth in the Bay Area, the ideas she encountered there, and what the dreamers she met did as they grew up. We also discuss how she came up with the term ‘open source software’ (and how she had to get someone else to propose it). Today Christine helps runs the Foresight Institute, which fills a gap left by for-profit technology companies – predicting how new revolutionary technologies could go wrong, and ensuring we steer clear of the downsides. We dive into: * Whether the poor security of computer systems poses a catastrophic risk for the world. Could all our essential services be taken down at once? And if so, what can be done about it? * Can technology ‘move fast and break things’ without eventually breaking the world? Would it be better for technology to advance more quickly, or more slowly? * How Christine came up with the term ‘open source software’ (and why someone else had to propose it). * Will AIs designed for wide-scale automated hacking make computers more or less secure? * Would it be good to radically extend human lifespan? Is it sensible to cryogenically freeze yourself in the hope of being resurrected in the future? * Could atomically precise manufacturing (nanotechnology) really work?

         <description><![CDATA[Every year tens of billions of animals are raised in terrible conditions in factory farms before being killed for human consumption. Over the last two years Lewis Bollard – Project Officer for Farm Animal Welfare at the Open Philanthropy Project – has conducted extensive research into the best ways to eliminate animal suffering in farms as soon as possible. This has resulted in $30 million in grants to farm animal advocacy.<br><br>

We covered almost every approach being taken, which ones work, and how individuals can best contribute through their careers.<br><br>

We also had time to venture into a wide range of issues that are less often discussed, including:<br><br>

* Why Lewis thinks insect farming would be worse than the status quo, and whether we should look for ‘humane’ insecticides;<br>
* How young people can set themselves up to contribute to scientific research into meat alternatives;<br>
* How genetic manipulation of chickens has caused them to suffer much more than their ancestors, but could also be used to make them better off;<br>
* Why Lewis is skeptical of vegan advocacy;<br>
* Why he doubts that much can be done to tackle factory farming through legal advocacy or electoral politics;<br>
* Which species of farm animals is best to focus on first;<br>
* Whether fish and crustaceans are conscious, and if so what can be done for them;<br>

         <description><![CDATA[The scientific revolution in the 16th century was one of the biggest societal shifts in human history, driven by the discovery of new and better methods of figuring out who was right and who was wrong. <br><br>

Julia Galef - a well-known writer and researcher focused on improving human judgment, especially about high stakes questions - believes that if we could again develop new techniques to predict the future, resolve disagreements and make sound decisions together, it could dramatically improve the world across the board. We brought her in to talk about her ideas.<br><br>

Julia has been host of the Rationally Speaking podcast since 2010, co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality in 2012, and is currently working for the Open Philanthropy Project on an investigation of expert disagreements.<br><br>

In our conversation we ended up speaking about a wide range of topics, including:<br><br>

* Her research on how people can have productive intellectual disagreements.<br>
* Why she once planned to become an urban designer.<br>
* Why she doubts people are more rational than 200 years ago.<br>
* What makes her a fan of Twitter (while I think it’s dystopian).<br>
* Whether people should write more books.<br>
* Whether it’s a good idea to run a podcast, and how she grew her audience.<br>
* Why saying you don’t believe X often won’t convince people you don’t.<br>
* Why she started a PhD in economics but then stopped.<br>
* Whether she would recommend an unconventional career like her own.<br>
* Whether the incentives in the intelligence community actually support sound thinking.<br>
* Whether big institutions will actually pick up new tools for improving decision-making if they are developed.<br>
* How to start out pursuing a career in which you enhance human judgement and foresight.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[Of all the people whose well-being we should care about, only a small fraction are alive today. The rest are members of future generations who are yet to exist. Whether they’ll be born into a world that is flourishing or disintegrating – and indeed, whether they will ever be born at all – is in large part up to us. As such, the welfare of future generations should be our number one moral concern.<br><br>

This conclusion holds true regardless of whether your moral framework is based on common sense, consequences, rules of ethical conduct, cooperating with others, virtuousness, keeping options open – or just a sense of wonder about the universe we find ourselves in.<br><br>

That’s the view of Dr Toby Ord, a philosophy Fellow at the University of Oxford and co-founder of the effective altruism community. In this episode of the 80,000 Hours Podcast Dr Ord makes the case that aiming for a positive long-term future is likely the best way to improve the world.<br><br>

We then discuss common objections to long-termism, such as the idea that benefits to future generations are less valuable than those to people alive now, or that we can’t meaningfully benefit future generations beyond taking the usual steps to improve the present.<br><br>

Later the conversation turns to how individuals can and have changed the course of history, what could go wrong and why, and whether plans to colonise Mars would actually put humanity in a safer position than it is today.<br><br>

This episode goes deep into the most distinctive features of our advice. It’s likely the most in-depth discussion of how 80,000 Hours and the effective altruism community think about the long term future and why - and why we so often give it top priority. <br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[<p>Quantitative financial trading is one of the highest paying parts of the world’s highest paying industry. 25 to 30 year olds with outstanding maths skills can earn millions a year in an obscure set of ‘quant trading’ firms, where they program computers with predefined algorithms to allow them to trade very quickly and effectively.<br><br>

This makes it an attractive place to work for people who want to ‘earn to give’, and we know several people who are able to donate over a million dollars a year to effective charities by working in quant trading.

* What quant traders do and how much they earn.<br>
* Whether their work is beneficial or harmful for the world.<br>
* How to figure out if you’re a good personal fit for quant trading, and if so how to break into the industry.<br>
* Whether he enjoys the work and finds it motivating, and what other careers he considered.<br>
* What variety of positions are on offer, and what the culture is like in different firms.<br>
* How he decides where to donate, and whether he has persuaded his colleagues to join him.<br><br>

         <description><![CDATA[What disaster is most likely to kill more than 10 million human beings in the next 20 years? Terrorism? Famine? An asteroid?<br><br>

Actually it’s probably a pandemic: a deadly new disease that spreads out of control. We’ve recently seen the risks with Ebola and swine flu, but they pale in comparison to the Spanish flu which killed 3% of the world’s population in 1918 to 1920. A pandemic of that scale today would kill 200 million.<br><br>

In this in-depth interview I speak to Howie Lempel, who spent years studying pandemic preparedness for the Open Philanthropy Project. We spend the first 20 minutes covering his work at the foundation, then discuss how bad the pandemic problem is, why it’s probably getting worse, and what can be done about it.<br><br>

In the second half we go through where you personally could study and work to tackle one of the worst threats facing humanity.<br><br>
