But<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160203085855.htm"> a recent paper </a>in <em>Nature: Plants </em>suggests that as a farming system, it scores better than conventional farming systems on many key indicators of sustainability. This, say the paper's authors, suggests organic systems should be playing a larger role in world food production than it currently is.</p>
<p>In this episode, I talk to Jonathan Wachtel, co-author of the study. We talk about sustainability metrics, current barriers to the expansion of organic systems, and why we shouldn't assume that organic farming alone can feed the world.  </p>

I bought his book on a whim, and am I ever glad I did. Many years ago, Craig fell in love with growing tomatoes, and then, specifically, heirloom tomatoes, and he eventually put everything he learned about tomato history, and the art and science of growing beautiful tomatoes, down on paper. I roared through the book. And then, impressed with what I read, I asked Craig to come on the show to talk about his passion. And, it is a passion. Craig figures he has five thousand tomato varieties in his collection, and that he's personally grown out more than 2000 of them. This episode: part one of our conversation, which focuses on heirloom history, and practical considerations for starting tomatoes in the nursery and pruning them in the field. Part two, which includes a best-of varietal list for commercial growers, comes out next week.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I recently had a chance to speak with Rochelle Eisen, who is an expert on all things organic in Canada. Rochelle has been an organic inspector, AKA organic verification officer, for years, and she's been involved in various levels of the oraganic farming certification bureaucracy throughout that time. Rochelle joined me to explain how the organic bureacratic machine works. Sounds boring, I know, but I think you'll really enjoy this if you've ever wondered how organic standards are formed or changed, or how you can influence them. If you're currently an organic farmer, or think you might be in future, or like to spout off about how the system is corrupt, or how the system is too expensive or too onerous, you should give this a listen. The topic may be a little bland, but Rochelle is the hotsauce that makes it enjoyable. A note to my american listeners that Rochelle and I focus on the Canadian organic system which she tells me is quite different than yours. I still think you'll find value here though. It may just make you want to go and learn more about the American system.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guts is a Canadian feminist magazine that recently published a piece by Natalie Childs called <a href="http://gutsmagazine.ca/featured/the-fruits-of-unpaid-labour">The Fruits of Unpaid Labour.</a> Natalie's article is a thoughtful consideration of the reality of low- and no-pay farm apprenticeships on many small-scale farms in Canada, and the implications for both the farmers and the apprentices involved. Natalie, who completed a farm apprenticeship a few summers back and now works on a farm in Quebec, is my guest for this episode, along with Robin Johnston and Bernard Soubrey, two young farmers based in Atlantic Canada who also went through the apprenticeship system and share Natalie's concerns about underpaid farm labour on some small-scale farms. </p>

It's about what happened when food scientists figured out how to manufacture thousands of flavours at the same time that the flavour and nutrition of real food began a steep decline. It turns out that the flavour and nutrition of food are intimately linked, and that when we figured out how to divorce the two, the consequences were, and continue to be, pretty negative.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode features two segments on hard-won insights from farmers. </p> <p>My first conversation is with Delaney Zayac of <a href= "http://icecaporganics.com/">Ice Cap Organics</a>. His intensive growing practices and short season make it hard to maintain sufficient organic matter in his soil. His new approach? Delaney bought a <a href= "http://www.harperturfequipment.com/blowers/top-feed-straw-blower/"> tractor attachment</a> that chops and spreads straw onto his beds and/or pathways. The resulting mulch is good for weed suppression, moisture retention, and. ultimately, for adding organic matter to the soil. </p> <p>Conversation two is with Andrea Gunner of <a href= "http://rosebankfarms.ca">Rosebank Farms</a>. Government-imposed production limits made it hard for Andrea to exploit economies of scale in her pastured poultry operation. More independant producers in her region could potentially team up to exploit economies of scale together through cooperation, so Andrea began mentoring new farmers near her farm and then cooperating with them on bulk feed purchases and slaughter.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode, contributor Scott Humphries' interview with Sean Butler of <a href="http://fermeetforet.ca/">Ferme et Foret</a>. To finance part of their farm's growth, Sean and his wife Geneviève asked friends and family to invest in their vision by selling 'bonds' that paid a small rate of return on investment. They call it 'Community Financed Farming'. Sound familiar? The couple took some inspiration from Paul Slomp of Grazing Days Farm, who talked about his own success with this model on <a href="https://theruminant.squarespace.com/the-podcast/2013/10/30/the-ruminant-podcast-episode-20-paul-slomp-grazing-days-farm-and-funding-your-farm-start-up-by-selling-bonds">episode 20</a> of the podcast. </p>
<p>Also: I asked for some good ideas that you implemented on your farms this past season, and, well, one of you responded. Dan Brisebois of <a href="https://www.fermetournesol.qc.ca/en/">Ferme Tourne-Sol</a> tells us about all the labour he saved this year by mulching his garden pathways with landscape fabric, and how you can do it, too. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, organic farmer, advocate, and activist Linda Edwards joins me to talk about the recent approval of the Arctic Apple for production and consumption in North America. The Arctic Apple is a genetically modified crop that will not brown when cut open. There are naturally occurring apples that don't brown quickly, but in this case, a gene that causes browning has been silenced using genetic engineering. </p>
<p>Linda explains why many organic and conventional orchardists are opposed to the Arctic Apple. We also discuss the organic industry's opposition to genetically engineered crops in general. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a past episode that, until now, hasn't been included in this podcast feed. I've added a new intro, as well as a brand new segment at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>In this long-form interview with gardening writer Steve Solomon, we discuss his new book, The Intelligent Gardener, which he co-wrote with Erica Reinheimer.</p>
<p>In it, Steve argues that the key to growing healthy crops is to combine the return of organic matter to the soil with a practice called remineralization, which involves assessing the mineral content of your soil and then adding the right mix of amendments to ensure they are in proper balance (Steve's contention: few soils are). Along the way, Steve provides an excellent beginner's entry into soil science, and challenges some of the organic movement's tightly held assumptions about sustainable crop production.</p>
<p>This is part 2 of our conversation. In this segment we focus on the assertions Steve makes in his book regarding healthy vegetables, how to achieve a nutrient-balanced soil, and why organic gardeners should be open to the idea of using certain synthetic fertilizers.</p>]]></description>

<p>In 2000, she founded a non-profit organization called <a href="http://www.sustainablegrains.org/index.html">The Whole Grain Connection</a>, which aims to help farmers and gardeners access, test and grow heirloom varieties of wheat. Why? In this interview, Monica explains why modern, commercial wheat varieties kind of suck if you're interested in nutrition and taste, and why a rediscovery of older varieties of wheat could be so good for food security.</p>
<p>Monica also provides some advice on getting started with producing wheat and other grains on your farm or in the garden. She says it's easy to do, and no space is too small. </p>
<p>Monica also co-authored a book on this subject, with her husband Gene. It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Fiber-Better-High-fiber-Plant-based/dp/159120111X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428552582&sr=8-1&keywords=what%27s+with+fiber">What's With Fiber?</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode: part two of my conversation with Molly Haviland, a soil biology consultant who aims to convince you to take your soil's microorganisms more seriously. Molly argues that the complex relationships that develop between many different types of microorganisms in our soil are the key to unlocking the soil's true potential to produce healthy food. We abuse and ignore the soil biome at our peril, in fact.  </p>
<p>Improving the soil biome starts with reducing tillage, reducing or eliminating the addition of soil amendments, and making great compost, and then, if necessary, applying compost teas and extracts to fine tune microbe populations. I've broken our conversation into two parts, which will be released concurrently. In this one, we talk about compost extracts and teas, and their role in improving soil health.</p>]]></description>

Whatcom County (and Western Washington in general) produces a large variety of vegetables, berries, dairy products, and to a lesser degree, fruits, fish and meat.
